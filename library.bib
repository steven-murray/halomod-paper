  abstract = {We investigate some aspects of the statistical geometry of 2D random fields relevant to studies of temperature anisotropies in the microwave background. We extend the work of Coles \& Barrow to calculate the expectation values of the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of the excursion sets of Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields above various threshold levels. Monte Carlo simula-tions of Gaussian and non-Gaussian fields possessing the covariance function expected in CDM models are used to assess the usefulness of this, and other, pattern statistics as discriminators between Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields and hence between Gaussian and non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations. We find that such statistics should provide useful alternatives to 'standard' tests based on higher order correlations. We discuss the expected fractal behaviour of temperature contours. We discuss the implications of these results for the study of random fields in three dimensions, taking the view that the analytically simpler 2D case may provide a useful testing ground for ideas involved in the study of the 3D problem.},

The limits are derived in the framework of a sterile neutrino warm dark matter universe, but can be applied to gravitinos and other models with small-scale suppression in the linear matter power spectrum. With freedom in all cosmological parameters including the free streaming scale of the sterile neutrino dark matter, limits are derived using observations of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, the 3D clustering of galaxies and 1D clustering of gas in the Lyman-alpha (Ly{$\alpha$}) forest in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), as well as the Ly{$\alpha$} forest in high-resolution spectroscopic observations. In the most conservative case, using only the SDSS main-galaxy 3D power-spectrum shape, the limit is ms{$>$}0.11keV; including the SDSS Ly{$\alpha$} forest, this limit improves to ms{$>$}1.7keV. More stringent constraints may be placed from the inferred matter power spectrum from high-resolution Ly{$\alpha$} forest observations, which has significant systematic uncertainties; in this case, the limit improves to ms{$>$}3.0keV (all at 95\% CL).},

  abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the \textasciitilde 2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120\textdegree{} long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of galaxy evolution rests on cross-sectional observations of different objects at different times. Understanding of galaxy evolution rests on longitudinal interpretations of how these data relate to individual objects moving through time. The connection between the two is generally assumed to be clear, but we use a simple "physics-free" model to show that it is not and that exploring its nuances can lead to new insights. Comprising nothing more than \$\textbackslash sim2000\$ loosely constrained lognormal star formation histories, the model faithfully reproduces the following data it was never designed to match: stellar mass functions at \$z\textbackslash leq8\$; the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the SF "Main Sequence") at \$z\textbackslash leq6\$; the mean \$\{\textbackslash rm sSFR\}(\textbackslash equiv\{\textbackslash rm SFR\}/M\_*)\$ of low-mass galaxies at \$z\textbackslash leq7\$; "fast-" and "slow-track quenching"; galaxy downsizing; and a correlation between formation timescale and \$\{\textbackslash rm sSFR\}(M\_*,t)\$ similar to recent results from simulations that provides a natural connection to bulge growth. We take these surprising findings -- which ultimately imply that quenching is the "peeling-off" of the densest tail of the starforming population at any epoch -- to mean either that: (1) models in which galaxies are diversified on long timescales by something akin to initial conditions rival the dominant "grow-and-quench" framework as good descriptions of the data; or (2) cornerstone metrics of galaxy evolution are too information-poor -- if not intrinsically misleading -- to confirm a unique explanation. We outline future tests of our model but stress that, even if it is shown to be incorrect, it illustrates how exploring different evolutionary paradigms can aid learning and, we hope, more detailed modeling efforts.}

After reviewing the role of active neutrinos in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, we focus on sterile neutrinos in the context of the Dark Matter puzzle. Here, we first review the physics motivation for sterile neutrino Dark Matter, based on challenges and tensions in purely cold Dark Matter scenarios. We then round out the discussion by critically summarizing all known constraints on sterile neutrino Dark Matter arising from astrophysical observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical considerations. In this context, we provide a balanced discourse on the possibly positive signal from X-ray observations. Another focus of the paper concerns the construction of particle physics models, aiming to explain how sterile neutrinos of keV-scale masses could arise in concrete settings beyond the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. The paper ends with an extensive review of current and future astrophysical and laboratory searches, highlighting new ideas and their experimental challenges, as well as future perspectives for the discovery of sterile neutrinos.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference is often used in cosmology and astrophysics to derive constraints on model parameters from observations. This approach relies on the ability to compute the likelihood of the data given a choice of model parameters. In many practical situations, the likelihood function may however be unavailable or intractable due to non-gaussian errors, non-linear measurements processes, or complex data formats such as catalogs and maps. In these cases, the simulation of mock data sets can often be made through forward modeling. We discuss how Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) can be used in these cases to derive an approximation to the posterior constraints using simulated data sets. This technique relies on the sampling of the parameter set, a distance metric to quantify the difference between the observation and the simulations and summary statistics to compress the information in the data. We first review the principles of ABC and discuss its implementation using a Population Monte-Carlo (PMC) algorithm and the Mahalanobis distance metric. We test the performance of the implementation using a Gaussian toy model. We then apply the ABC technique to the practical case of the calibration of image simulations for wide field cosmological surveys. We find that the ABC analysis is able to provide reliable parameter constraints for this problem and is therefore a promising technique for other applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Our implementation of the ABC PMC method is made available via a public code release.},

We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error.

Remarkably, we find that the redshift, mass and {$\sigma$}8 dependence of the mean smallest-to-largest axis ratio of haloes is well described by the simple power-law relation = (0.54 +/- 0.02)(Mvir/M*)-0.050+/-0.003, where s is measured at 0.3Rvir, and the z and {$\sigma$}8 dependences are governed by the characteristic non-linear mass, M*=M*(z, {$\sigma$}8). We find that the scatter about the mean s is well described by a Gaussian with {$\sigma\sptilde$} 0.1, for all masses and redshifts. We compare our results to a variety of previous works on halo shapes and find that reported differences between studies are primarily explained by differences in their methodologies. We address the evolutionary aspects of individual halo shapes by following the shapes of the haloes through \textasciitilde 100 snapshots in time. We determine the formation scalefactor ac as defined by Wechsler et al. and find that it can be related to the halo shape at z= 0 and its evolution over time.},

In particular, we consider three different approaches: polynomial fitting, principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). We review the motivations and algorithms for the three methods, and show that they can all be described, using the same mathematical framework, as different approaches to the blind source separation problem. We study the efficiency of foreground subtraction both in the angular and radial (frequency) directions, as well as the dependence of this efficiency on different instrumental and modelling parameters. For well-behaved foregrounds and instrumental effects, we find that foreground subtraction can be successful to a reasonable level on most scales of interest. We also quantify the effect that the cleaning has on the recovered signal and power spectra. Interestingly, we find that the three methods yield quantitatively similar results, with PCA and ICA being almost equivalent.},

We use a high-resolution N-body simulation of a {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) universe, together with the results of Colberg, Krughoff \& Connolly, who identified filaments connecting pairs of clusters. We find that cluster pairs connected by a filament are strongly aligned with the cluster-cluster axis, whereas unconnected ones are not. For smaller, galaxy-size haloes, there also is an alignment signal, but its strength is independent of whether the halo is part of an obvious large-scale structure. Additionally, we find no measurable dependence of galaxy halo shape on membership of a filament. We also quantify the influence of tidal fields and find that these do correlate strongly with alignments of haloes. The alignments of most haloes are thus caused by tidal fields, with cluster-size haloes being strongly aligned through the added mechanism of infall of matter from filaments.},

Simulations have demonstrated that typical dark matter particle orbits extend out to about 90 per cent of their turnaround radius, which results in apocentre passages outside of the current 'virial' radius on the first and also on the second orbit. Here we describe how the formation history of haloes can be used to identify those particles which took part in the halo collapse, but are missed by conventional group finders because of their remote present location. These particles are added to the part of the halo already identified by FoF. The corrected masses of dark haloes are significantly higher (the median mass increase is 25 per cent) and there is a considerable shift of the halo mass function towards the Press and Schechter form. We conclude that meaningful quantitative comparisons between (semi-)analytic predictions of halo properties (e.g. mass functions, mass accretion rates, merger rates, spatial clustering, etc.) and simulation results will require using the same halo definition in both approaches.},

These use the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample, which contains 264,283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effective redshift z=0.57 and redshift range 0.43 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7. Assuming a concordance Lambda-CDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc\^3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, n = 3 x 10\^-4 h\^-3 Mpc\^3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5\textbackslash sigma in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II Luminous Red Galaxy Sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7\textbackslash sigma. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z=0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV /rs = 13.67 +/- 0.22 at z=0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV(z=0.57) = 2094 +/- 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

As a result of the large simulation volume and the use of a novel ``cross-moment'' counts-in-cells technique which suppresses discreteness noise, we are able to measure the clustering of haloes corresponding to rarer peaks than was possible in previous studies; the rarest haloes for which we measure the variance are 100 times more clustered than the dark matter. We are able to extract, for the first time, halo bias parameters from linear up to fourth order. For all orders measured, we find that the bias parameters are a strong function of mass for haloes more massive than the characteristic mass \$M\_\{*\}\$. Currently, no theoretical model is able to reproduce this mass dependence closely. We find that the bias parameters also depend on the internal structure of the halo up to fourth order. For haloes more massive than \$M\_\{*\}\$, we find that the more concentrated haloes are more weakly clustered than the less concentrated ones. We see no dependence of clustering on concentration for haloes with masses \$M},

We find that the subhalo mass function departs significantly from a power law at the high-mass end. We also find that the radial and angular distributions of substructures depend on subhalo mass. In particular, high-mass subhaloes tend to be less radially concentrated and to have angular distributions closer to the direction perpendicular to the spin of the host halo than their less massive counterparts. We find that mergers between subhaloes occur. These tend to be between substructures that were already dynamically associated before accretion into the main halo. For subhaloes larger than 0.001 times the mass of the host halo, it is more likely that the subhalo will merge with the central or main subhalo than with another subhalo larger than itself. For lower masses, subhalo-subhalo mergers become equally likely to mergers with the main subhalo. Our results have implications for the variation of galaxy properties with environment and for the treatment of mergers in galaxy formation models.},

Unfortunately, an accurate scrutiny of the WDM predictions with N-body simulations has proven difficult due to numerical artefacts. Here, we report on cosmological simulations that, for the first time, are devoid of those problems, and thus are able to accurately resolve the WDM halo mass function well below the cut-off. We discover a complex picture, with perturbations at different evolutionary stages populating different ranges in the halo mass function. On the smallest mass scales we can resolve, identified objects are typically centres of filaments that are starting to collapse. On intermediate mass scales, objects typically correspond to fluctuations that have collapsed and are in the process of relaxation, whereas the high-mass end is dominated by objects similar to haloes identified in CDM simulations. We then explicitly show how the formation of low-mass haloes is suppressed, which translates into a strong cut-off in the halo mass function. This disfavours some analytic formulations that predict a halo mass function that would extend well below the free streaming mass. We argue for a more detailed exploration of the formation of the smallest structures expected to form in a given cosmology, which, we foresee, will advance our overall understanding of structure formation.},

These two properties together make s\_LP, called the "linear point", an excellent cosmological standard ruler. The linear point is also appealing because it is easily identified irrespectively of how non-linearities distort the correlation function. Finally, the correlation function amplitude at s\_LP is similarly insensitive to non-linear corrections to within a few percent. Hence, exploiting the particular Baryon features in the correlation function, we propose three new estimators for growth measurements. A preliminary analysis of s\_LP in current data is encouraging.},

  abstract = {Detection of the 21-cm signal coming from the epoch of reionization  (EoR) is challenging especially because, even after removing the foregrounds, the residual Stokes I maps contain leakage from polarized emission that can mimic the signal. Here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and present realistic simulations of the leakages between Stokes parameters. From the LOFAR observations of polarized emission in the 3C196 field, we have quantified the level of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of LOFAR, and compared it with the EoR signal using power spectrum analysis. We found that at 134-166 MHz, within the central 4\textdegree{} of the field the (Q, U) \textrightarrow{} I leakage power is lower than the EoR signal at k {$<$} 0.3 Mpc-1. The leakage was found to be localized around a Faraday depth of 0, and the rms of the leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown to vary between 0.2 and 0.3 per cent, both of which could be utilized in the removal of leakage. Moreover, we could define an `EoR window' in terms of the polarization leakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the point spread function (PSF)-induced wedge and below k{$\parallel$} \texttildelow{} 0.5 Mpc-1, and the window extended up to k{$\parallel$} \texttildelow{} 1 Mpc-1 at all k{$\perp$} when 70 per cent of the leakage had been removed. These LOFAR results show that even a modest polarimetric calibration over a field of view of {$\lessequivlnt$} 4\textdegree{} in the future arrays like Square Kilometre Array will ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below the expected EoR signal at the scales of 0.02-1 Mpc-1.},

Therefore, understanding polarimetric performance of the antenna is crucial for a successful detection of the EoR signal. Here, we have calculated the accuracy of the nominal model beam of Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) in predicting the leakage from Stokes I to Q, U by comparing them with the corresponding leakage of compact sources actually observed in the 3C 295 field. We have found that the model beam has errors of {$\leq$}10 per cent on the predicted levels of leakage of \texttildelow 1 per cent within the field of view, i.e. if the leakage is taken out perfectly using this model the leakage will reduce to 10-3 of the Stokes I flux. If similar levels of accuracy can be obtained in removing leakage from Stokes Q, U to I, we can say, based on the results of our previous paper, that the removal of this leakage using this beam model would ensure that the leakage is well below the expected EoR signal in almost the whole instrumental k-space of the cylindrical power spectrum. We have also shown here that direction-dependent calibration can remove instrumentally polarized compact sources, given an unpolarized sky model, very close to the local noise level.},

  abstract = {Leakage of polarized Galactic diffuse emission into total intensity can  potentially mimic the 21-cm signal coming from the epoch of reionization (EoR), as both of them might have fluctuating spectral structure. Although we are sensitive to the EoR signal only in small fields of view, chromatic side-lobes from further away can contaminate the inner region. Here, we explore the effects of leakage into the `EoR window' of the cylindrically averaged power spectra (PS) within wide fields of view using both observation and simulation of the 3C196 and North Celestial Pole (NCP) fields, two observing fields of the LOFAR-EoR project. We present the polarization PS of two one-night observations of the two fields and find that the NCP field has higher fluctuations along frequency, and consequently exhibits more power at high-k{$\parallel$} that could potentially leak to Stokes I. Subsequently, we simulate LOFAR observations of Galactic diffuse polarized emission based on a model to assess what fraction of polarized power leaks into Stokes I because of the primary beam. We find that the rms fractional leakage over the instrumental k-space is 0.35 \{per cent\} in the 3C196 field and 0.27 \{per cent\} in the NCP field, and it does not change significantly within the diameters of 15\textdegree, 9\textdegree, and 4\textdegree. Based on the observed PS and simulated fractional leakage, we show that a similar level of leakage into Stokes I is expected in the 3C196 and NCP fields, and the leakage can be considered to be a bias in the PS.},

  abstract = {We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energy models from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data. We take advantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and the Ly-alpha forest (LyaF) in the BOSS survey of SDSS-III. BAO data alone yield a high confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the CMB angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Combining BAO and SN data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7\% measurement of \$H\_0=67.3 \textbackslash pm1.1\$ km/s/Mpc. This measurement assumes standard pre-recombination physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature, so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat LCDM cosmology is an important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For open LCDM, our BAO+SN+CMB combination yields \$\textbackslash Omega\_m=0.301 \textbackslash pm 0.008\$ and curvature \$\textbackslash Omega\_k=-0.003 \textbackslash pm 0.003\$. When we allow more general forms of evolving dark energy, the BAO+SN+CMB parameter constraints remain consistent with flat LCDM. While the overall \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAO measurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions. Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high redshifts remain consistent with our constraints, but models where dark matter decays into radiation are sharply limited. Expansion history alone yields an upper limit of 0.56 eV on the summed mass of neutrino species, improving to 0.26 eV if we include Planck CMB lensing. Standard dark energy models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates. (Abridged)},

  abstract = {Using high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations, we study how the density profiles of dark matter halos are affected by the filtering of the density power spectrum below a given scale length and by the introduction of a thermal velocity dispersion. In the warm dark matter (WDM) scenario, both the free-streaming scale, Rf, and the velocity dispersion, vwth, are determined by the mass, mW, of the WDM particle. We found that vwth is too small to affect the density profiles of WDM halos. Down to the resolution attained in our simulations (\textasciitilde 0.01 virial radii), there is not any significant difference in the density profiles and concentrations of halos obtained in simulations with and without the inclusion of vwth. Resolved soft cores appear only when we artificially increase the thermal velocity dispersion to a value that is much higher than vwth. We show that the size of soft cores in a monolithic collapse is related to the tangential velocity dispersion. The density profiles of the studied halos with masses down to \textasciitilde 0.01 the filtering mass Mf can be described by the Navarro-Frenk-White shape; soft cores are not formed. Nevertheless, the concentrations of these halos are lower than those of the CDM counterparts and are approximately independent of mass. The cosmogony of halos with masses {$<\sptilde$}Mf is not hierarchical: they form through monolithic collapse and by fragmentation of larger structures. The formation epoch of these halos is slightly later than that of halos with masses \textasciitilde Mf. The lower concentrations of WDM halos with respect to their CDM counterparts can be accounted for by their late formation epoch. Overall, our results point to a series of advantages of a WDM model over the CDM one. In addition to solving the substructure problem, a WDM model with Rf\textasciitilde 0.16 Mpc (mW\textasciitilde 0.75 keV; flat cosmology with {$\Omega\Lambda$}=h=0.7) also predicts concentrations, a Tully-Fisher relation, and formation epochs for small halos, which seems to be in better agreement with observations than CDM predictions.},

Much of the progress in understanding the physics of the high-redshift universe and comparison with observations would not have been possible without N-body simulations. Given the importance of this tool, it is essential to understand its limitations, as ignoring the limitations can easily lead to interesting but unreliable results. In this paper we study the limitations arising out of the finite size of the simulation volume. This finite size implies that modes larger than the size of the simulation volume are ignored and a truncated power spectrum is simulated. If the simulation volume is large enough then the mass in collapsed haloes expected from the full power spectrum and from the truncated power spectrum should match. We propose a quantitative measure based on this approach that allows us to compute the minimum box size for an N-body simulation. We find that the required box size for simulations of the {$\Lambda$}CDM model at high redshifts is much larger than is typically used. We can also use this approach to quantify the effect of perturbations at large scales for power-law models and we find that if we fix the scale of non-linearity, the required box size becomes very large as the index becomes small. The appropriate box size computed using this approach is also an appropriate choice for the transition scale when tools like MAP, which add the contribution of the missing power, are used.},

We explore these relationships down to halos of much lower mass (1011 h-1 Msolar) than previous studies. The halos are triaxial, with c/a ratios of 0.6+/-0.1 and a mean two-dimensional projected ellipticity of =0.24. More massive halos are more flattened. The axis ratios rise out to 0.6rvir, beyond which they drop. The principal axes, in particular the minor axes, are very well aligned within 0.6 rvir. High-mass halos show particularly strong internal alignment. The angular momentum vectors are also reasonably well aligned except between the very outermost and very innermost regions of the halo. The angular momentum vectors tend to align with the minor axes, with a mean misalignment of \textasciitilde 25\textdegree, and lie perpendicular to the major and intermediate axes. The properties of a halo at 0.4 rvir are quite characteristic of the properties at most other radii within the halo. There is a very strong tendency for the minor axes of halos to lie perpendicular to large-scale filaments, and a much weaker tendency for the major axes to lie along the filaments. This alignment extends to much larger separations for group and cluster mass halos than for galaxy mass halos. As a consequence, the intrinsic alignments of galaxies are likely weaker than previous predictions, which were based on the shapes of cluster mass halos. The angular momenta of the highest concentration halos tend to point toward other halos. The angular momenta of galaxy mass halos point parallel to filaments, while those of group and cluster mass halos show a very strong tendency to point perpendicular to the filaments. This suggests that group and cluster mass halos acquire most of their angular momentum from major mergers along filaments, while the accretion history of mass and angular momentum onto galaxy mass halos has been smoother.},

The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions.

  abstract = {We study the constraints that high-redshift structure formation in the universe places on warm dark matter (WDM) dominated cosmological models. We modify the extended Press-Schechter formalism to derive the halo mass function in WDM models. We show that our predictions agree with recent numerical simulations at low redshift over the halo masses of interest. Applying our model to galaxy formation at high redshift, we find that the loss of power on small scales, together with the delayed collapse of low-mass objects, results in strong limits on the root-mean-square velocity dispersion v\_rms of the WDM particles at z=0. For fermions decoupling while relativistic, these limits are equivalent to constraints on the mass m\_X of the particles. The presence of a 4 billion solar mass black hole at z=5.8, believed to power the quasar SDSS 1044-1215, implies m\_X {$>$} 0.5 keV (or v\_rms {$<$} 0.10 km/s), assuming that the quasar is unlensed and radiating at or below the Eddington limit. Reionization by z=5.8 also implies a limit on m\_X. If high-redshift galaxies produce ionizing photons with an efficiency similar to their z=3 counterparts, we find m\_X {$>$} 1.2 keV (or v\_rms {$<$} 0.03 km/s). However, given the uncertainties in current measurements from the proximity effect of the ionizing background at redshift 3, values of m\_X as low as 0.75 keV (v\_rms = 0.06 km/s) are not ruled out. The limit weakens further if, instead, the ionizing-photon production efficiency is greater at high z, but this limit will tighten considerably if reionization is shown in the future to have occurred at higher redshifts. WDM models with m\_X {$<$} 1 keV (v\_rms {$>$} 0.04 km/s) produce a low-luminosity cutoff in the high-redshift galaxy luminosity function which is directly detectable with the Next Generation Space Telescope (abridged).},

  abstract = {The cosmic radio-frequency spectrum is expected to show a strong absorption signal corresponding to the 21-centimetre-wavelength transition of atomic hydrogen around redshift 20, which arises from Lyman-{$\alpha$} radiation from some of the earliest stars. By observing this 21-centimetre signal\textemdash either its sky-averaged spectrum or maps of its fluctuations, obtained using radio interferometers\textemdash we can obtain information about cosmic dawn, the era when the first astrophysical sources of light were formed. The recent detection of the global 21-centimetre spectrum reveals a stronger absorption than the maximum predicted by existing models, at a confidence level of 3.8 standard deviations. Here we report that this absorption can be explained by the combination of radiation from the first stars and excess cooling of the cosmic gas induced by its interaction with dark matter. Our analysis indicates that the spatial fluctuations of the 21-centimetre signal at cosmic dawn could be an order of magnitude larger than previously expected and that the dark-matter particle is no heavier than several proton masses, well below the commonly predicted mass of weakly interacting massive particles. Our analysis also confirms that dark matter is highly non-relativistic and at least moderately cold, and primordial velocities predicted by models of warm dark matter are potentially detectable. These results indicate that 21-centimetre cosmology can be used as a dark-matter probe.},

We present end-to-end simulations of a full EoR power spectrum (PS) analysis including all of the major components of a real data processing pipeline: models of astrophysical foregrounds and EoR signal, frequency-dependent instrument effects, sky-based antenna calibration, and the full PS analysis. This study reveals that traditional sky-based per-frequency antenna calibration can only be implemented in EoR measurement analyses if the calibration model is unrealistically accurate. For reasonable levels of catalogue completeness, the calibration introduces contamination in otherwise foreground-free PS modes, precluding a PS measurement. We explore the origin of this contamination and potential mitigation techniques. We show that there is a strong joint constraint on the precision of the calibration catalogue and the inherent spectral smoothness of antennas, and that this has significant implications for the instrumental design of the SKA (Square Kilometre Array) and other future EoR observatories.},

We provide expressions taking linear and quadratic momentum correlations into account. Up to this point, the expressions are general with respect to the free propagator of the microscopic degrees of freedom.   We then specialise the propagator to that expected for particles in cosmology treated within the Zel'dovich approximation and show that, to linear order in the momentum correlations, the linear growth of the cosmological power spectrum is reproduced. Quadratic momentum correlations return a first contribution to the non-linear evolution of the power spectrum, for which we derive a simple closed expression valid for arbitrary wave numbers. This expression is a convolution of the initial density power spectrum with itself, multiplied by a mode-coupling kernel. We also derive the bispectrum expected in this theory within these approximations and show that its connected part reproduces almost, but not quite, the bispectrum expected in Eulerian perturbation theory of the density contrast.},

Galaxies are therefore not faithful tracers of the underlying matter distribution. This modulation of galaxy clustering, called bias, contains information about the physics behind galaxy formation. It is also a systematic to be overcome before the large-scale structure of the Universe can be used as a cosmological probe. Two types of approaches have been developed to model the clustering of galaxies. The first class is empirical and filters or weights the distribution of dark matter to reproduce the measured clustering. In the second approach, an attempt is made to model the physics which governs the fate of baryons in order to predict the number of galaxies in dark matter haloes. I will review the development of both approaches and summarise what we have learnt about galaxy bias.},

Direct imaging involves a spatial fast Fourier transform of antenna signals, alleviating an \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ant\}\}\^2)\$ computational bottleneck typical in radio correlators, and yielding a more gentle \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N\_g \textbackslash log\_2 N\_g)\$ scaling, where \$N\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ant\}\}\$ is the number of antennas in the array and \$N\_g\$ is the number of grid points in the imaging analysis. This can save orders of magnitude in computation cost for next generation arrays consisting of hundreds or thousands of antennas. However, because antenna signals are mixed in the imaging correlator without creating visibilities, gain correction must be applied prior to imaging, rather than on visibilities post-correlation. We develop the EPICal algorithm to form gain solutions quickly and without ever forming visibilities. This method scales as the number of antennas, and produces results comparable to those from visibilities. We use simulations to demonstrate the EPICal technique and study the noise properties of our gain solutions, showing they are similar to visibility based solutions in realistic situations. By applying EPICal to two seconds of Long Wavelength Array data we achieve a 65\% dynamic range improvement compared to uncalibrated images, showing this algorithm is a promising solution for next generation instruments.},

Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z=0 to z=4. The shape and evolution are well constrained for z {$<$} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in massive halos.

  abstract = {We study the properties of unbound dark matter particles, defined as having sufficient kinetic energy to escape the boundary of their parent halos. We find that the mass fraction of unbound particles increases strongly towards the edges of halos and in denser environments. Mergers are the largest source of unbound particles; however, major mergers are not especially more efficient than minor mergers in this regard. Because unbound dark matter particles can leave halos more easily than their baryonic counterparts, we also find that standard LCDM cosmology predicts a redshift-dependent boost for the baryon fraction in massive clusters which reaches as high as an extra \textasciitilde{} 20 percent at z=0 compared to the universal value. Our findings have relevance for dark matter detection experiments, precision calibrations of the halo mass function, the use of baryon fractions to constrain dark energy, and searches for intergalactic supernovae.},

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for identifying dark matter halos,  substructure, and tidal features. The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named ROCKSTAR (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ({$>$}1010 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown ROCKSTAR to have excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s-1 at z = 0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar.},

We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, star formation rates, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z=8. We also provide new compilations of cosmic and specific star formation rates; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10\^12 Msun are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z \textasciitilde{} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z \textasciitilde{} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for star formation histories that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the star formation history of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in LCDM.

  abstract = {We use a sample of about 22 000 galaxies at 0.65 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.2 from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) Public Data Release 1 (PDR-1) catalogue, to constrain the cosmological model through a measurement of the galaxy clustering ratio {$\eta$}g,R. This statistic has favourable properties, which is defined as the ratio of two quantities characterizing the smoothed density field in spheres of a given radius R: the value of its correlation function on a multiple of this scale, {$\xi$}(nR), and its variance {$\sigma$}2(R). For sufficiently large values of R, this is a universal number, which captures 2-point clustering information independently of the linear bias and linear redshift-space distortions of the specific galaxy tracers. In this paper, we discuss how to extend the application of {$\eta$}g,R to quasi-linear scales and how to control and remove observational selection effects, which are typical of redshift surveys as VIPERS, in detail. We verify the accuracy and efficiency of these procedures using mock catalogues that match the survey selection process. These results show the robustness of {$\eta$}g,R to non-linearities and observational effects, which is related to its very definition as a ratio of quantities that are similarly affected. At an effective redshift z = 0.93, we measured the value {$\eta$}g,R(15) = 0.141 {$\pm$} 0.013 at R = 5h-1 Mpc. Within a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology and by including the best available priors on H0, ns and baryon density, we obtain a matter density parameter at the current epoch {$\Omega$}m,0 = 0.270-0.025+0.029. In addition to the great precision achieved on our estimation of {$\Omega$}m using VIPERS PDR-1, this result is remarkable because it appears to be in good agreement with a recent estimate at z {$\simeq$} 0.3, which was obtained by applying the same technique to the SDSS-LRG catalogue. It, therefore, supports the robustness of the present analysis. Moreover, the combination of these two measurements at z \textasciitilde{} 0.3 and z \textasciitilde{} 0.9 provides us with a very precise estimate of {$\Omega$}m,0 = 0.274 {$\pm$} 0.017, which highlights the great consistency between our estimation and other cosmological probes, such as baryonic acoustic oscillations, cosmic microwave background, and supernovae.

  abstract = {Ninety years ago, in 1922, Alexander Friedman (1888-1925) demonstrated for the first time that the General Relativity equations admit non-static solutions and thus the Universe may expand, contract, collapse, and even be born. The fundamental equations he derived still provide the basis for the current cosmological theories of the Big Bang and the Accelerating Universe. Later, in 1924, he was the first to realize that General Relativity allows the Universe to be infinite. Friedman's ideas initially met strong resistance from Einstein, yet from 1931 he became their staunchest supporter. This essay connects Friedman's cosmological ideas with the 1998-2004 results of the astronomical observations that led to the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. It also describes Friedman's little known topological ideas of how to check General Relativity in practice and compares his contributions to those of Georges Lemaitre. Recently discovered corpus of Friedman's writings in the Ehrenfest Archives at Leiden University sheds some new light on the circumstances surrounding his 1922 work and his relations with Paul Ehrenfest.}

In addition, an even larger contribution from vacuum energy (or cosmological constant) is indicated by recent observations. To the theoretically favoured particle candidates for non-baryonic dark matter belong axions, supersymmetric particles, and of less importance, massive neutrinos. The theoretical foundation and experimental situation for each of these is reviewed. Direct and indirect methods for detection of supersymmetric dark matter are described in some detail.

By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of P(N|M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of {$\xi$}g(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical and semianalytic models in reproducing this form is entirely nontrivial. Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion, and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias. We outline a strategy for determining the HOD empirically from redshift survey data. This method starts from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that cosmological and HOD parameters will have nondegenerate effects on galaxy clustering, so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical determinations of the HOD as a function of galaxy type from the Two-Degree Field (2dF) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation, insight into the origin of galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological models.},

Here we introduce a flexible methodology, BACCUS: BAyesian Conservative Constraints and Unknown Systematics, which deals in a conservative way with the problem of data combination, for any degree of tension between experiments. We introduce hyperparameters that describe a bias in each model parameter for each class of experiments. A conservative posterior for the model parameters is then obtained by marginalization both over these unknown shifts and over the width of their prior. We contrast this approach with an existing hyperparameter method in which each individual likelihood is scaled, comparing the performance of each approach and their combination in application to some idealized models. Using only these rescaling hyperparameters is not a suitable approach for the current observational situation, in which internal null tests of the errors are passed, and yet different experiments prefer models that are in poor agreement. The possible existence of large shift systematics cannot be constrained with a small number of data sets, leading to extended tails on the conservative posterior distributions. We illustrate our method with the case of the \$H\_0\$ tension between results from the cosmic distance ladder and physical measurements that rely on the standard cosmological model.},

Results are illustrated by detailed comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections deal with applications to observations. First, we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to weak gravitational lensing.

Aims: Astrophysical foregrounds are expected to be about three orders of magnitude greater than the cosmological signal and therefore represent a serious contamination of the cosmological 21 cm line. Detailed knowledge of both their intensity and polarization structure on the relevant angular scale of 1-30 arcmin will be essential for extracting the cosmological signal from the data. Methods: We present the first results from a series of observations conducted with the Westerbork telescope in the 140-160 MHz range with a 2 arcmin resolution aimed at characterizing the properties of the foregrounds for epoch of reionization experiments. The polarization data were analysed through the rotation measure synthesis technique. We computed total intensity and polarization angular power spectra. Results: For the first time we have detected fluctuations in the Galactic diffuse emission on scales greater than 13 arcmin at 150 MHz, in the low Galactic latitude area known as Fan region, centred at {$\alpha$} = 3\^h10\^m, {$\delta$} = 65\textdegree{} 30'. Those fluctuations have an rms of 14 K. The total intensity power spectrum shows a power-law behaviour down to {$\mathscr{l}$} 900 with slope {$\beta\sphat$}I\_{$\mathscr{l}$} = -2.2 {$\pm$} 0.3. The detection of diffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual point sources. We measured an rms confusion noise of 3 mJy beam-1. Diffuse polarized emission was also detected for the first time at this frequency. The polarized signal shows complex structure both spatially and along the line of sight. The polarization power spectrum is not affected by residual point sources and is only limited by the thermal noise. It shows a power-law behaviour down to {$\mathscr{l}$} 2700 with slope {$\beta\sphat$}P\_{$\mathscr{l}$} = -1.65 {$\pm$} 0.15. The rms of polarization fluctuations is 7.2 K on 4 arcmin scales. Conclusions: The measured total intensity fluctuations are used to estimate the foreground contamination on the cosmological signal. By extrapolating the spectrum of total intensity emission, we find a contamination of {$\delta$} T= {$\surd\lbrace\mathscr{l}$} ({$\mathscr{l}$}+1) C\^I\_{$\mathscr{l}$} / 2{$\pi\rbrace$} \texttildelow{} 5.7 K on 5 arcmin scales and a corresponding rms value of 18.3 K at the same angular scale. The level of the polarization power spectrum is {$\delta$} T 3.3 K on 5 arcmin scales. However, the Fan region cannot be taken as representative of other sky regions, given its exceptionally bright polarized signal, but is likely to represent an upper limit on the sky brightness at moderate and high Galactic latitude.},

  abstract = {Context. In the coming years a new insight into galaxy formation and the  thermal history of the Universe is expected to come from the detection of the highly redshifted cosmological 21 cm line. Aims: The cosmological 21 cm line signal is buried under Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds which are likely to be a few orders of magnitude brighter. Strategies and techniques for effective subtraction of these foreground sources require a detailed knowledge of their structure in both intensity and polarization on the relevant angular scales of 1-30 arcmin. Methods: We present results from observations conducted with the Westerbork telescope in the 140-160 MHz range with 2 arcmin resolution in two fields located at intermediate Galactic latitude, centred around the bright quasar 3C 196 and the North Celestial Pole. They were observed with the purpose of characterizing the foreground properties in sky areas where actual observations of the cosmological 21 cm line could be carried out. The polarization data were analysed through the rotation measure synthesis technique. We have computed total intensity and polarization angular power spectra.  Results: Total intensity maps were carefully calibrated, reaching a high dynamic range, 150 000:1 in the case of the 3C 196 field. No evidence of diffuse Galactic emission was found in the angular power spectrum analysis on scales smaller than \textasciitilde 10 arcmin in either of the two fields. On these angular scales the signal is consistent with the classical confusion noise of \textasciitilde 3 mJy beam-1. On scales greater than 30 arcmin we found an excess of power attributed to the Galactic foreground with an rms of 3.4 K and 5.5 K for the 3C 196 and the NCP field respectively. The intermediate angular scales suffered from systematic errors which prevented any detection. Patchy polarized emission was found only in the 3C 196 field whereas the polarization in the NCP area was essentially due to radio frequency interference. The polarized signal in the 3C 196 field is close to the thermal noise for angular scales smaller than \textasciitilde 10 arcmin. On scales greater than 30 arcmin it has an rms value of 0.68 K. The polarized signal appears mainly at rotation measure values smaller than 4 rad m-2. Conclusions: In regard of the detection of the cosmological 21 cm line, we conclude that Galactic total intensity emission lacks small-scale power, which is below the confusion noise level at the angular resolution of 2 arcmin. Galactic polarization, given its relative weakness and its small rotation measure values, is less severe than expected as a contaminant of the cosmological 21 cm line.},

Though an individual antenna could in principle detect the line signature, data analysis must separate foregrounds that are orders of magnitude brighter than the {$\lambda$}21 cm background (but that are anticipated to vary monotonically and gradually with frequency, e.g., they are considered ``spectrally smooth''). Using more physically motivated models for foregrounds than in previous studies, we show that the intrinsic spectral smoothness of the foregrounds is likely not a concern, and that data analysis for an ideal antenna should be able to detect the {$\lambda$}21 cm signal after subtracting a {$\sim$}fifth-order polynomial in log {$\nu$}. However, we find that the foreground signal is corrupted by the angular and frequency-dependent response of a real antenna. The frequency dependence complicates modeling of foregrounds commonly based on the assumption of spectral smoothness. Our calculations focus on the Large-aperture Experiment to detect the Dark Age, which combines both radiometric and interferometric measurements. We show that statistical uncertainty remaining after fitting antenna gain patterns to interferometric measurements is not anticipated to compromise extraction of the {$\lambda$}21 cm signal for a range of cosmological models after fitting a seventh-order polynomial to radiometric data. Our results generalize to most efforts to measure the sky-averaged spectrum.},

  abstract = {We investigate the spins and shapes of over a million dark matter haloes identified at z = 0 in the Millennium simulation. Our sample spans halo masses ranging from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters. The very large dynamic range of this {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmological simulation enables the distribution of spins and shapes and their variation with halo mass and environment to be characterized with unprecedented precision. We compare results for haloes identified using three different algorithms, and investigate (and remove) biases in the estimate of angular momentum introduced both by the algorithm itself and by numerical effects. We introduce a novel halo definition called the TREE halo, based on the branches of the halo merger trees, which is more appropriate for comparison with real astronomical objects than the traditional `friends-of-friends' and `spherical overdensity' (SO) algorithms. We find that for this many objects, the traditional lognormal function is no longer an adequate description of the distribution, P({$\lambda$}), of the dimensionless spin parameter {$\lambda$}, and we provide a different function that gives a better fit for TREE and SO haloes. The variation in spin with halo mass is weak but detectable, although the trend depends strongly on the halo definition used. For the entire population of haloes, we find median values of {$\lambda$}med = 0.0367-0.0429, depending on the definition of a halo. The haloes exhibit a range of shapes, with a preference for prolateness over oblateness. More-massive haloes tend to be less spherical and more prolate. We find that the more-spherical haloes have less coherent rotation in the median, and those closest to being spherical have a spin independent of mass ({$\lambda$}med \textasciitilde{} 0.033). The most-massive haloes have a spin independent of shape ({$\lambda$}med \textasciitilde{} 0.032). The majority of haloes have their angular momentum vector aligned with their minor axis and perpendicular to their major axis. We find a general trend for higher spin haloes to be more clustered, with a stronger effect for more-massive haloes. For galaxy cluster haloes, this can be larger than a factor of \textasciitilde 2.},

Since the distribution of galaxy-halo alignments is not known in detail, we test various alignment models, together with different methods of determining the halo shape. In addition to alignment, we examine the interplay of halo mass and shape, and galaxy colour and morphology with the resulting stacked projected halo shape. We find that only in the case where significant numbers of galaxy and halo minor axes are parallel does the stacked, projected halo axis ratio fall below 0.95. When using broader misalignment distributions, such as those found in recent simulations of galaxy formation, the halo ellipticity signal is washed out and would be extremely difficult to measure observationally. It is important to note that the spread in stacked halo axis ratio due to theoretical unknowns (differences between semi-analytic models and between alignment models) are much bigger than any statistical uncertainty. It is na\"ive to assume that, simply because {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) predicts aspherical haloes, the stacked projected shape will be elliptical. In fact, there is no robust {$\Lambda$}CDM prediction yet for this procedure, and the interpretation of any such elliptical halo signal from lensing in terms of physical halo properties will be extremely difficult.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the stellar mass dependence of galaxy clustering in the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). The near-infrared selection of 6dFGS allows more reliable stellar mass estimates compared to optical bands used in other galaxy surveys. Using the halo occupation distribution model, we investigate the trend of dark matter halo mass and satellite fraction with stellar mass by measuring the projected correlation function, wp(rp). We find that the typical halo mass (M1) as well as the satellite power-law index (alpha) increases with stellar mass. This indicates (1) that galaxies with higher stellar mass sit in more massive dark matter haloes and (2) that these more massive dark matter haloes accumulate satellites faster with growing mass compared to haloes occupied by low stellar mass galaxies. Furthermore, we find a relation between M1 and the minimum dark matter halo mass (Mmin) of M1 {$\approx$} 22 Mmin, in agreement with similar findings for Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. The satellite fraction of 6dFGS galaxies declines with increasing stellar mass from 21 per cent at Mstellar = 2.6 \texttimes{} 1010 h-2 M\&sun; to 12 per cent at Mstellar = 5.4 \texttimes{} 1010 h-2 M\&sun; indicating that high stellar mass galaxies are more likely to be central galaxies. We compare our results to two different semi-analytic models derived from the Millennium Simulation, finding some disagreement. Our results can be used for placing new constraints on semi-analytic models in the future, particularly the behaviour of luminous red satellites. Finally, we compare our results to studies of halo occupation using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing. We find good overall agreement, representing a valuable cross-check for these two different tools of studying the matter distribution in the Universe.},

  abstract = {Maximally Smooth Functions (MSFs) are a form of constrained functions in which there are no inflection points or zero crossings in high order derivatives. Consequently, they have applications to signal recovery in experiments where signals of interest are expected to be non-smooth features masked by larger smooth signals or foregrounds. They can also act as a powerful tool for diagnosing the presence of systematics. However, the constrained nature of MSFs makes fitting these functions a non-trivial task. Here, we introduce maxsmooth, an open source package that uses quadratic programming to rapidly fit MSFs. We demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of maxsmooth by comparison to commonly used fitting routines. We show that by using quadratic programming we can reduce the fitting time by approximately two orders of magnitude. maxsmooth features a built-in library of MSF models and allows the user to define their own. We also introduce and implement with maxsmooth Partially Smooth Functions, which are useful for describing elements of non-smooth structure in foregrounds. This work has been motivated by the problem of foreground modelling in 21-cm cosmology for which MSFs have been shown to be a viable alternative to polynomial models. We discuss applications of maxsmooth to 21-cm cosmology and highlight this with examples using data from the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES) and the Large-aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) experiments. MSFs are applied to data from LEDA for the first time in this paper. maxsmooth is pip installable and available for download at: https://github.com/htjb/maxsmooth},

The sizes of \$N\$-body simulations are now such that, for the most part, results need no longer be statistics-limited, but are still subject to various systematic uncertainties. We investigate and discuss some of the reasons for these differences. Quantifying error sources and compensating for them as appropriate, we carry out a high-statistics study of dark matter halos from 67 \$N\$-body simulations to investigate the mass function and its evolution for a reference \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology and for a set of \$w\$CDM cosmologies. For the reference \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology (close to WMAP5), we quantify the breaking of universality in the form of the mass function as a function of redshift, finding an evolution of as much as 10\% away from the universal form between redshifts \$z=0\$ and \$z=2\$. For cosmologies very close to this reference we provide a fitting formula to our results for the (evolving) \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM mass function over a mass range of \$6\textbackslash cdot 10\^\{11\}-3\textbackslash cdot 10\^\{15\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ to an estimated accuracy of about 2\%. The set of \$w\$CDM cosmologies is taken from the Coyote Universe simulation suite. The mass functions from this suite (which includes a \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology and others with \$w\textbackslash simeq-1\$) are described by the fitting formula for the reference \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM case at an accuracy level of 10\%, but with clear systematic deviations. We argue that, as a consequence, fitting formulae based on a universal form for the mass function may have limited utility in high precision cosmological applications.},

We carry out (gravity-only) simulations of the current concordance LCDM cosmology, covering a halo mass range of 2.10\^(12) to 2.10\^(15) solar masses and a redshift range of z=0-2, dictated primarily by cluster observation considerations. We find that the shape of the concentration-mass (c-M) relation flattens at high redshift and this flattening of the slope is naturally expressed if c is written as a function of the peak height parameter, \textbackslash nu. Although the logarithmic slope of the c-M relation changes with redshift, that of the (c-\textbackslash nu) relation is effectively constant over the redshift range z=0-2. The amplitude of c(\textbackslash nu) varies by about 30\% from z=0-2 over the mass range for massive clusters. The (c-\textbackslash nu) relation is, however, not universal. We use a large suite of simulations covering the currently allowed wCDM parameter space and show that the (c-\textbackslash nu) relation varies by about +/- 20 \% when cosmological parameters are varied. We find that the distribution of the concentrations can be well-fit by a Gaussian with variance, \textbackslash sigma\_c=0.33c, where the ratio of the variance to the mean, \textbackslash sigma\_c/c, is independent of the radius at which the concentration is defined, the dynamical state of the halo, and the underlying cosmology. We compare our simulation predictions with current results obtained from (primarily low) redshift observations and find good agreement with the observational data for massive clusters of mass {$>$} 4.10\^(14) solar masses, but there are disagreements at lower masses.

  abstract = {We measure the angular power spectrum of radio galaxies in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) using two independent methods: direct spherical harmonic analysis and maximum likelihood estimation. The results are consistent and can be understood using models for the spatial matter power spectrum and for the redshift distribution of radio galaxies at mJy flux-density levels. A good fit to the angular power spectrum can only be achieved if radio galaxies possess high bias with respect to mass fluctuations; by marginalizing over the other parameters of the model we derive a 68\% confidence interval 1.53 {$<$} b\_0 sigma\_8 {$<$} 1.87, where b\_0 is the linear bias factor for radio galaxies and sigma\_8 describes the normalization of the matter power spectrum. Our models indicate that the majority of the signal in the NVSS angular power spectrum is generated at low redshifts. Individual redshifts for the NVSS sources are thus required to alleviate projection effects and probe directly the matter power spectrum on large scales.},

In this study we use 380 000 photometric redshifts to measure significant deviations from the canonical power-law fit to the angular correlation function in a series of narrow redshift slices, in which we construct volume-limited samples. These deviations are direct signatures of the manner in which these galaxies populate the underlying network of dark matter haloes. We cleanly delineate the separate contributions of the 'one-halo' and 'two-halo' clustering terms and fit our measurements by parametrizing the halo occupation distribution N(M) of the galaxies. Our results are successfully fitted by a 'central' galaxy contribution with a 'soft' transition from zero to one galaxy, combined with a power-law 'satellite' galaxy component, the slope of which is a strong function of galaxy luminosity. The large majority of galaxies are classified as central objects of their host dark matter haloes rather than satellites in more massive systems. The effective halo mass of MegaZ-LRG galaxies lies in the range log(10)(M-eff/h(-1) M-circle dot) = 13.61-13.80 (increasing with redshift assuming large-scale normalization sigma(8) = 0.8) for corresponding number densities in the range n(g) = 5.03 - 0.56 x 10(4) h(-3) Mpc(-3). Our results confirm the usefulness of the halo model for gaining physical insight into the patterns of galaxy clustering.},

We describe in detail how we construct the survey selection function allowing for the varying target completeness and redshift completeness. We measure the total power with an accuracy of approximately 5 per cent in wavenumber bands of {$\Delta$}k = 0.01h Mpc-1. A model power spectrum including non-linear corrections, combined with a linear galaxy bias factor and a simple model for redshift-space distortions, provides a good fit to our data for scales k {$<$} 0.4h Mpc-1. The large-scale shape of the power spectrum is consistent with the best-fitting matter and baryon densities determined by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. By splitting the power spectrum measurement as a function of tangential and radial wavenumbers, we delineate the characteristic imprint of peculiar velocities. We use these to determine the growth rate of structure as a function of redshift in the range 0.4 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.8, including a data point at z = 0.78 with an accuracy of 20 per cent. Our growth rate measurements are a close match to the self-consistent prediction of the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter model. The WiggleZ survey data will allow a wide range of investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion and growth history, topology of cosmic structure and Gaussianity of the initial conditions.

We determine the joint covariance of the Fourier-space multipoles in a Gaussian approximation, and indicate how these techniques may be extended to studies of overlapping galaxy populations via multipole cross-power spectra. We apply our methodology to one of the widest-area galaxy redshift surveys currently available, the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey, deducing a normalized growth rate f*sigma\_8 = 0.38 +/- 0.12 in the low-redshift Universe, in agreement with previous analyses of this dataset using different techniques.

Our work has relevance for the spatial power spectrum analysis of galaxy surveys with spectroscopic or accurate photometric redshifts, and radio intensity-mapping surveys of the sky brightness temperature including generic noise, telescope beams and pixelization. We consider the auto-power spectrum of a field, the cross-power spectrum between two fields and the multipoles of these power spectra with respect to a curved sky, deriving the corresponding power spectrum models, estimators, errors and optimal weights. We note that "FKP weights" for individual tracers do not in general provide the optimal weights when measuring the cross-power spectrum. We validate our models using mock datasets drawn from N-body simulations, and provide the python code we use for these tests at https://github.com/cblakeastro/intensitypower.

We explore the impact of baryons, propose an improved parametrization for spherical overdensity masses, and identify differences between our DMonly HMF and previously published HMFs. We use the Magneticum simulations, which are well suited because of their accurate treatment of baryons, high resolution, and large cosmological volumes of up to (3818 Mpc)3. Baryonic effects globally decrease the masses of galaxy clusters, which, at a given mass, results in a decrease of their number density. This effect vanishes at high redshift z \texttildelow{} 2 and for high masses M200 m {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1014 M{$\odot$}. We perform cosmological analyses of three idealized approximations to the cluster surveys by the South Pole Telescope (SPT), Planck, and eROSITA. We pursue two main questions. (1) What is the impact of baryons? - for the SPT-like and the Planck-like samples, the impact of baryons on cosmological results is negligible. In the eROSITA-like case, however, neglecting the baryonic impact leads to an underestimate of {$\Omega$}m by about 0.01, which is comparable to the expected uncertainty from eROSITA. (2) How does our DMonly HMF compare with previous work? - for the Planck-like sample, results obtained using our DMonly HMF are shifted by {$\Delta$}({$\sigma$}8) {$\simeq$} {$\Delta$}({$\sigma$}8({$\Omega$}m/0.27)0.3) {$\simeq$} 0.02 with respect to results obtained using the Tinker et al. fit. This suggests that using our HMF would shift results from Planck clusters towards better agreement with cosmic-microwave-background anisotropy measurements. Finally, we discuss biases that can be introduced through inadequate HMF parametrizations that introduce false cosmological sensitivity.},

We investigate the nonlinear gravitational clustering of WDM with a high-resolution N-body code and identify a number of distinctive observational signatures. Relative to CDM, halo concentrations and core densities are lowered, core radii are increased, and large halos emerge with far fewer low-mass satellites. The number of small halos is suppressed, and those present are formed by ``top-down'' fragmentation of caustics, as part of a ``cosmic web'' connecting massive halos. Few small halos form outside this web. If we identify small halos with dwarf galaxies, then their number, spatial distribution, and formation epoch appear in better agreement with the observations for WDM than they are for CDM.},

We test its performance on foreground simulations of increasing complexity, designed to challenge the parametric models adopted. We also drop the assumption of spectral smoothness that most of the methods rely upon.

Since low values of omega are indicated by dynamical studies of galaxy clustering, cold particle models in which light traces mass are probably incorrect. Reheating of the pregalactic medium is unlikely to modify this conclusion. In cold particle or neutrino-dominated universes with omega = 1, presented predictions for small-scale and quadrupole anisotropies are below current limits. In all cases, the small-scale fluctuations are predicted to be about 10 percent linearly polarized.},

  abstract = {An efficient algorithm is proposed for Bayesian model calibration, which is commonly used to estimate the model parameters of non-linear, computationally expensive models using measurement data. The approach is based on Bayesian statistics: using a prior distribution and a likelihood, the posterior distribution is obtained through application of Bayes' law. Our novel algorithm to accurately determine this posterior requires significant fewer discrete model evaluations than traditional Monte Carlo methods. The key idea is to replace the expensive model by an interpolating surrogate model and to construct the interpolating nodal set maximizing the accuracy of the posterior. To determine such a nodal set an extension to weighted Leja nodes is introduced, based on a new weighting function. We prove that the convergence of the posterior has the same rate as the convergence of the model. If the convergence of the posterior is measured in the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the rate doubles. The algorithm and its theoretical properties are verified in three different test cases: analytical cases that confirm the correctness of the theoretical findings, Burgers' equation to show its applicability in implicit problems, and finally the calibration of the closure parameters of a turbulence model to show the effectiveness for computationally expensive problems.},

Although the overall agreement is reasonable, there are slight inconsistencies which are most easily interpreted as a reflection of ellipsoidal collapse (as opposed to spherical collapse assumed in the Press\textendash Schechter formalism). We show that the average mass accretion histories follow a simple, universal profile, and we present a simple recipe for computing the two scale-parameters which is applicable to a wide range of halo masses and cosmologies. Together with the universal profiles for the density and angular momentum distributions of cold dark matter haloes, these universal mass accretion histories provide a simple but accurate framework for modelling the structure and formation of dark matter haloes. In particular, they can be used as a backbone for modelling various aspects of galaxy formation where one is not interested in the detailed effects of merging. As an example we use the universal mass accretion history to compute the rate at which dark matter haloes accrete mass, which we compare with the cosmic star formation history of the Universe.},

The simulations are the first to include the unavoidable instrumental effects of the frequency-dependent primary antenna beams and synthesized array beams. They recover the one-dimensional spherically binned input redshifted 21 cm power spectrum within \textasciitilde 1\% over the scales probed most sensitively by the MWA (0.01 lsim k lsim 1 Mpc-1) and demonstrate that realistic instrumental effects will not mask the epoch of reionization signal. We find that the weighting function used to produce the dirty sky maps from the gridded visibility measurements is important to the success of the technique. Uniform weighting of the visibility measurements produces the best results, whereas natural weighting significantly worsens the foreground subtraction by coupling structure in the density of the visibility measurements to spectral structure in the dirty sky map data cube. The extremely dense uv-coverage of the MWA was found to be advantageous for this technique and produced very good results on scales corresponding to |u| lsim 500{$\lambda$} in the uv-plane without any selective editing of the uv-coverage.},

  abstract = {After stars formed in the early Universe, their ultraviolet light is expected, eventually, to have penetrated the primordial hydrogen gas and altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre hyperfine line. This alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave background, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz1. Here we report the detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by early stars; however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the largest predictions2. This discrepancy suggests that either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background radiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such as radiation from stars and stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this discrepancy; of the proposed extensions to the standard model of cosmology and particle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions between dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude3. The low-frequency edge of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had produced a background of Lyman-{$\alpha$} photons by 180 million years after the Big Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was heated to above the radiation temperature less than 100 million years later.},

We combine WMAP5 results with two different Lyman-{$\alpha$} data sets, including observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We pay a special attention to systematics, test various possible sources of error, and compare the results of different statistical approaches.

Within the mass range studied here (5 keV {$<$} mNRP {$<$} {$\infty$}), we find that any mass value is allowed when FWDM {$<$} 0.6 (frequentist 99.7\% confidence limit); similarly, the Bayesian joint probability on (FWDM, 1/mNRP) allows any value of the mass at the 95\% confidence level, provided that FWDM {$<$} 0.35.},

After reviewing the existing approaches, we choose two methods to derive such a bound. The first one depends on the information about the current phase space distribution of DM particles only, while the second one uses both the initial and final distributions. We discuss the recent data on dSphs as well as astronomical uncertainties in relevant parameters. As an application, we present lower bounds on the mass of DM particles, coming from various dSphs, using both methods. The model-independent bound holds for any type of fermionic DM. Stronger, model-dependent bounds are quoted for several DM models (thermal relics, non-resonantly and resonantly produced sterile neutrinos, etc.). The latter bounds rely on the assumption that baryonic feedback cannot significantly increase the maximum of a distribution function of DM particles. For the scenario in which all the DM is made of sterile neutrinos produced via non-resonant mixing with the active neutrinos (NRP) this gives mNRP {$>$} 1.7 keV. Combining these results in their most conservative form with the X-ray bounds of DM decay lines, we conclude that the NRP scenario remains allowed in a very narrow parameter window only. This conclusion is independent of the results of the Lyman-{$\alpha$} analysis. The DM model in which sterile neutrinos are resonantly produced in the presence of lepton asymmetry remains viable. Within the minimal neutrino extension of the Standard Model (the {$\nu$}MSM), both mass and the mixing angle of the DM sterile neutrino are bounded from above and below, which suggests the possibility for its experimental search.},

This is in marked contrast to the well-established monotonic relation between galaxy luminosity and halo circular velocity (or halo mass) for more massive haloes. We show that at least two (and typically four) of these massive dark subhaloes are expected to produce a larger dark matter annihilation flux than Draco. It may be possible to circumvent these conclusions if baryonic feedback in dwarf satellites or different dark matter physics can reduce the central densities of massive subhaloes by order unity on a scale of 0.3-1 kpc.},

We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement.  The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed passband, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

We focus on how these processes influence the spin and shape of a large number of DM haloes covering a wide range of mass scales, from dwarf galaxies to clusters, at redshifts zero, one and two. The haloes are extracted from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations, a suite of state-of-the-art high-resolution cosmological simulations run with a range of feedback prescriptions. We find that the median spin parameter in DM-only simulations is independent of mass, redshift and cosmology. Baryons increase the spin of the DM in the central region ({$<$} 0.25r\_\{200\}) by up to 50 per cent when feedback is weak or absent. This increase can be attributed to the transfer of angular momentum from baryons to the DM. We also present fits to the mass dependence of the DM halo shape at both low and high redshift. At z=0 the sphericity (triaxiality) is negatively (positively) correlated with halo mass and both results are independent of cosmology. Interestingly, these mass-dependent trends are markedly weaker at z=2. While the cooling of baryons acts to make the overall DM halo more spherical, stronger feedback prescriptions (e.g. from active galactic nuclei) tend to reduce the impact of baryons by reducing the central halo mass concentration. More generally, we demonstrate a strongly positive (negative) correlation between halo sphericity (triaxiality) and galaxy formation efficiency, with the latter measured using the central halo baryon fraction. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effects of baryons on the DM halo spin and shape are minor when the effects of cooling are mitigated, as required by realistic models of galaxy formation, although they remain significant for the inner halo.},

  abstract = {We detect a weak unidentified emission line at E = (3.55-3.57) {$\pm$} 0.03 keV in a stacked XMM-Newton spectrum of 73 galaxy clusters spanning a redshift range 0.01-0.35. When the full sample is divided into three subsamples (Perseus, Centaurus+Ophiuchus+Coma, and all others), the line is seen at {$>$}3{$\sigma$} statistical significance in all three independent MOS spectra and the PN "all others" spectrum. It is also detected in the Chandra spectra of the Perseus Cluster. However, it is very weak and located within 50-110 eV of several known lines. The detection is at the limit of the current instrument capabilities. We argue that there should be no atomic transitions in thermal plasma at this energy. An intriguing possibility is the decay of sterile neutrino, a long-sought dark matter particle candidate. Assuming that all dark matter is in sterile neutrinos with ms = 2E = 7.1 keV, our detection corresponds to a neutrino decay rate consistent with previous upper limits. However, based on the cluster masses and distances, the line in Perseus is much brighter than expected in this model, significantly deviating from other subsamples. This appears to be because of an anomalously bright line at E = 3.62 keV in Perseus, which could be an Ar XVII dielectronic recombination line, although its emissivity would have to be 30 times the expected value and physically difficult to understand. Another alternative is the above anomaly in the Ar line combined with the nearby 3.51 keV K line also exceeding expectation by a factor of 10-20. Confirmation with Astro-H will be critical to determine the nature of this new line.},

  abstract = {I present an analysis of the density shapes of dark matter halos in LCDM and LWDM cosmologies. The main results are derived from a statistical sample of galaxy-mass halos drawn from a high resolution LCDM N-body simulation. Halo shapes show significant trends with mass and redshift: low-mass halos are rounder than high mass halos, and, for a fixed mass, halos are rounder at low z. Contrary to previous expectations, which were based on cluster-mass halos and non-COBE normalized simulations, LCDM galaxy-mass halos at z=0 are not strongly flattened, with short to long axis ratios of s = 0.70 +/- 0.17. I go on to study how the shapes of individual halos change when going from a LCDM simulation to a simulation with a warm dark matter power spectrum (LWDM). Four halos were compared, and, on average, the WDM halos are more spherical than their CDM counterparts (s =0.77 compared to s = 0.71). A larger sample of objects will be needed to test whether the trend is significant.},

The simulations were initialized using the same set of modes, except on small scales, where the power was suppressed in WDM below the filtering length. Remarkably, WDM as well as CDM halos are well described by the two-parameter angular momentum profile of Bullock and coworkers, even though the halo masses are below the filtering scale of the WDM. Although the best-fit shape parameters change quantitatively for individual halos in the two simulations, we find no systematic variation in profile shapes as a function of the dark matter type. The scatter in shape parameters is significantly smaller for the WDM halos, suggesting that substructure and/or merging history plays a role in producing scatter about the mean angular momentum distribution, but that the average angular momentum profiles of halos originate from larger scale phenomena or a mechanism associated with the virialization process. The known mismatch between the angular momentum distributions of dark halos and disk galaxies is, therefore, present in WDM as well as CDM models. Our WDM halos tend to have a less coherent (more misaligned) angular momentum structure and smaller spin parameters than do their CDM counterparts, although we caution that this result is based on a small number of halos.},

  abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter (\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than \$\textbackslash sim 1\$ Mpc and mass scales smaller than \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{11\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark-matter dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naively predicted in \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM: Cusp/Core, Missing Satellites, and Too-Big-to-Fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both will be required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over then next decade. These efforts will either further verify the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

We selected for analysis the most relaxed systems possessing the highest quality data currently available in the Chandra and XMM-Newton public data archives. A power-law model fitted to the X-ray c-M relation requires at high significance (6.6 {$\sigma$}) that c decreases with increasing M, which is a general feature of CDM models. The median and scatter of the c-M relation produced by the flat, concordance {$\Lambda$}CDM model ({$\Omega$}m=0.3, {$\sigma$}8=0.9) agrees with the X-ray data, provided that the sample is comprised of the most relaxed, early-forming systems, which is consistent with our selection criteria. When allowing only {$\sigma$}8 to vary in the concordance model, the c-M relation requires 0.76{$<\sigma$}8{$<$}1.07 (99\% confidence), assuming a 10\% upward bias in the concentrations for early-forming systems. The tilted, low-{$\sigma$}8 model suggested by a new WMAP analysis is rejected at 99.99\% confidence, but a model with the same tilt and normalization can be reconciled with the X-ray data by increasing the dark energy equation of state parameter to w\textasciitilde -0.8. When imposing the additional constraint of the tight relation between {$\sigma$}8 and {$\Omega$}m from studies of cluster abundances, the X-ray c-M relation excludes ({$>$}99\% confidence) both open CDM models and flat CDM models with {$\Omega$}m\textasciitilde 1. This result provides novel evidence for a flat, low-{$\Omega$}m universe with dark energy using observations only in the local (z{$<<$}1) universe. Possible systematic errors in the X-ray mass measurements of a magnitude \textasciitilde 10\% suggested by CDM simulations do not change our conclusions.},

  abstract = {The structure and dark matter halo core properties of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are investigated. A double-isothermal model of an isothermal stellar system, embedded in an isothermal dark halo core provides an excellent fit to the various observed stellar surface density distributions. The stellar system can be well characterised by King profiles with a broad distribution of concentration parameters c. The core scale length of the stellar system a\_* is sensitive to the central dark matter density rho\_0. In contrast to single-component systems, the cut-off radius of the stellar system, rs\_t, however does not trace the tidal radius but the core radius r\_c of its dark matter halo. c is therefore sensitive to the ratio of the stellar to the dark matter velocity dispersion, sigma\_*/sigma\_0. Simple empirical relationships are derived that allow to calculate the dark halo core parameters rho\_0, r\_c and sigma\_0, given the observable quantities sigma\_*, a\_* and c. The DIS model is applied to the Milky Way's dSphs. Their halo velocity dispersions lie in a narrow range of 10km/s {$<$}= sigma\_0 {$<$}= 18km/s with halo core radii of 280pc {$<$}= r\_c {$<$}= 1.3kpc and r\_c=2a\_*. All dSphs follow closely the same universal dark halo core scaling relation rho\_0*r\_c=75 Msolar/pc\^2 that characterises the cores of more massive galaxies over several orders of magnitude in mass. The dark matter core mass is a strong function of core radius. Inside a fixed radius r\_u, with r\_u the logarithmic mean of the dSph's core radii, the total enclosed mass M\_u is however roughly constant, although outliers should exist. For our dSphs we find r\_u=400pc and M\_u=2.6*10\^7 Msolar. The core densities of the Galaxy's dSphs are very high, with rho\_0=0.2 Msolar/pc\^3. They should therefore be tidally undisturbed. Observational evidence for tidal effects might then provide a serious challenge for the cold dark matter scenario.},

In this paper, we show that redundant calibration is vulnerable to errors from sky model incompleteness even in the limit of perfect antenna positioning and identical beams. These errors are at a level that can overwhelm the EoR signal and prevent a detection. Finally, we suggest error mitigation strategies with implications for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).},

This link is already implicit in the constitutive relations between the field strengths and excitations, which are an essential part of the axiomatic structure of electromagnetism, clearly formulated via integration theory and differential forms. We briefly review the foundations of electromagnetism based on charge and magnetic flux conservation, the Lorentz force and the constitutive relations which introduce the spacetime metric. We then proceed with the tensor formulation by assuming local, linear, homogeneous and isotropic constitutive relations, and explore the physical, observable consequences of Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime. The field equations, charge conservation and the Lorentz force are explicitly expressed in general (pseudo) Riemanian manifolds. The generalized Gauss and Maxwell-Amp\textbackslash `\{e\}re laws, as well as the wave equations, reveal potentially interesting astrophysical applications. In all cases new electromagnetic couplings and related phenomena are induced by spacetime curvature. The implications and possible applications for gravity waves detection are briefly addressed. At the foundational level, we discuss the possibility of generalizing the vacuum constitutive relations, by relaxing the fixed conditions of homogeneity and isotropy, and by assuming that the symmetry properties of the electro-vacuum follow the spacetime isometries. The implications of this extension are briefly discussed in the context of the intimate connection between electromagnetism and the geometry (and causal structure) of spacetime.},

We use the conditional luminosity function (which describes the halo occupation statistics as a function of galaxy luminosity) combined with the halo model (which describes the non-linear matter field in terms of its halo building blocks) to describe the galaxy-dark matter connection. We explicitly account for residual redshift-space distortions in the projected galaxy-galaxy correlation functions, and marginalize over uncertainties in the scale dependence of the halo bias and the detailed structure of dark matter haloes. Under the assumption of a spatially flat, vanilla {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmology, we focus on constraining the matter density, {$\Omega$}m, and the normalization of the matter power spectrum, {$\sigma$}8, and we adopt 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) priors for the spectral index, n, the Hubble parameter, h, and the baryon density, {$\Omega$}b. We obtain that {$\Omega$}m = 0.278+ 0.023- 0.026 and {$\sigma$}8 = 0.763+ 0.064- 0.049 (95 per cent CL). These results are robust to uncertainties in the radial number density distribution of satellite galaxies, while allowing for non-Poisson satellite occupation distributions results in a slightly lower value for {$\sigma$}8 (0.744+ 0.056- 0.047). These constraints are in excellent agreement (at the 1{$\sigma$} level) with the cosmic microwave background constraints from WMAP. This demonstrates that the use of a realistic and accurate model for galaxy bias, down to the smallest non-linear scales currently observed in galaxy surveys, leads to results perfectly consistent with the vanilla {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology.},

A number of recent studies using this probe have claimed tension with the cosmology preferred by the analysis of the Planck primary CMB data, in the sense that there are fewer clusters observed than predicted based on the primary CMB cosmology. One possible resolution to this problem is systematic errors in the absolute halo mass calibration in cluster studies, which is required to convert the standard theoretical prediction (the halo mass function) into counts as a function of the observable (e.g., X-ray luminosity, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, optical richness). Here we propose an alternative strategy, which is to directly compare predicted and observed cluster counts as a function of the one-dimensional velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies. We argue that the velocity dispersion of groups/clusters can be theoretically predicted as robustly as mass but, unlike mass, it can also be directly observed, thus circumventing the main systematic bias in traditional cluster counts studies. With the aid of the BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate the potential of the velocity dispersion counts for discriminating even similar lambda CDM models. These predictions can be compared with the results from redshift surveys such as the highly complete Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey.},

Our peaked-spectrum sources are the low frequency analogues of gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) and compact-steep spectrum (CSS) sources, which have been hypothesized to be the precursors to massive radio galaxies. Our sample more than doubles the number of known peaked-spectrum candidates, and 95\% of our sample have a newly characterized spectral peak. We highlight that some GPS sources peaking above 5 GHz have had multiple epochs of nuclear activity, and demonstrate the possibility of identifying high redshift (\$z {$>$} 2\$) galaxies via steep optically thin spectral indices and low observed peak frequencies. The distribution of the optically thick spectral indices of our sample is consistent with past GPS/CSS samples but with a large dispersion, suggesting that the spectral peak is a product of an inhomogeneous environment that is individualistic. We find no dependence of observed peak frequency with redshift, consistent with the peaked-spectrum sample comprising both local CSS sources and high-redshift GPS sources. The 5 GHz luminosity distribution lacks the brightest GPS and CSS sources of previous samples, implying that a convolution of source evolution and redshift influences the type of peaked-spectrum sources identified below 1 GHz. Finally, we discuss sources with optically thick spectral indices that exceed the synchrotron self-absorption limit.},

We optimize the method by populating with galaxies friends-of-friends dark matter haloes extracted from the Marenostrum Institut de Ci\`encies de l'Espai dark matter simulations and comparing them to observational constraints. Our resulting mock galaxy catalogues manage to reproduce the observed local galaxy luminosity function and the colour-magnitude distribution as observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. They also reproduce the observed galaxy clustering properties as a function of luminosity and colour. In order to achieve that, the algorithm also includes scatter in the halo mass-galaxy luminosity relation derived from direct SHAM and a modified Navarro-Frenk-White mass density profile to place satellite galaxies in their host dark matter haloes. Improving on general usage of the HOD that fits the clustering for given magnitude limited samples, our catalogues are constructed to fit observations at all luminosities considered and therefore for any luminosity subsample. Overall, our algorithm is an economic procedure of obtaining galaxy mock catalogues down to faint magnitudes that are necessary to understand and interpret galaxy surveys.},

We perform hydrodynamic simulations for 5 different models: cold dark matter and WDM with 1,2,3,4 keV (thermal relic) mass and assign the neutral hydrogen a-posteriori using two different methods that both reproduce observations in terms of column density distribution function of neutral hydrogen systems. Contrary to naive expectations, the suppression of power present in the linear and non-linear matter power spectra, results in an increase of power in terms of neutral hydrogen and 21 cm power spectra. This is due to the fact that there is a lack of small mass halos in WDM models with respect to cold dark matter: in order to distribute a total amount of neutral hydrogen within the two cosmological models, a larger quantity has to be placed in the most massive halos, that are more biased compared to the cold dark matter cosmology. We quantify this effect and address significance for the telescope SKA1-LOW, including a realistic noise modeling. The results indicate that we will be able to rule out a 4 keV WDM model with 5000 hours of observations at z{$>$}3, with a statistical significance of {$>$}3 {$\sigma$}, while a smaller mass of 3 keV, comparable to present day constraints, can be ruled out at more than 2 {$\sigma$} confidence level with 1000 hours of observations at z{$>$}5.},

We measure this profile directly and find that it is more extended than a top hat but less extended than a Gaussian; its shape is well described by rounding the edges of the top hat by convolution with a Gaussian that has a scale length about 5 times smaller. This effective window Weff is particularly simple in Fourier space, and has an analytic form in real space. Together with the excursion set bias parameters, Weff describes the scale-dependence of the Lagrangian halo-matter cross correlation up to k RLag{$\sim$}10 , where RLag is the Lagrangian size of the protohalo. Moreover, with this Weff, all the spectral moments of the power spectrum are finite, allowing a straightforward estimate of the excursion set peak mass function. This estimate requires a prescription of the critical overdensity enclosed within a protohalo if it is to collapse, which we calibrate from simulations. We find that the resulting estimate of halo abundances is only accurate to about 20\%, and we discuss why: a top hat in "infall time" towards the protohalo center need not correspond to a top hat in the initial spatial distribution, so models in which infall rather than smoothed overdensity is the relevant variable may be more accurate.},

We apply a non-parametric technique, Generalized Morphological Component Analysis (gmca), to simulated Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)-EoR data and show that it has the ability to clean the foregrounds with high accuracy. We recover the 21-cm 1D, 2D and 3D power spectra with high accuracy across an impressive range of frequencies and scales. We show that gmca preserves the 21-cm phase information, especially when the smallest spatial scale data is discarded. While it has been shown that LOFAR-EoR image recovery is theoretically possible using image smoothing, we add that wavelet decomposition is an efficient way of recovering 21-cm signal maps to the same or greater order of accuracy with more flexibility. By comparing the gmca output residual maps (equal to the noise, 21-cm signal and any foreground fitting errors) with the 21-cm maps at one frequency and discarding the smaller wavelet scale information, we find a correlation coefficient of 0.689, compared to 0.588 for the equivalently smoothed image. Considering only the pixels in a central patch covering 50 per cent of the total map area, these coefficients improve to 0.905 and 0.605, respectively, and we conclude that wavelet decomposition is a significantly more powerful method to denoise reconstructed 21-cm maps than smoothing.},

  abstract = {The removal of the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds remains a major challenge for those wishing to make a detection of the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal. Multiple methods of modelling these foregrounds with varying levels of assumption have been trialled and shown promising recoveries on simulated data. Recently however there has been increased discussion of using the expected shape of the foregrounds in Fourier space to define an EoR window free of foreground contamination. By carrying out analysis within this window only, one can avoid the foregrounds and any statistical bias they might introduce. In this paper we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both foreground removal and foreground avoidance. We create a series of simulations with noise levels in line with both current and future experiments and compare the recovered statistical cosmological signal from both methods. We also relax the assumption that the foregrounds are smooth by introducing a Gaussian random factor along the line-of-sight and then also spatially. We find that, while foreground avoidance enables a slightly better recovery at high kperp, the most significant part of the cosmological signal is lost. While the EoR window is almost entirely obscured for a non-smooth foreground simulation, GMCA is able to recover the signal almost as well as for a smooth foreground for a line-of-sight variation.},

  abstract = {The exceptional sensitivity of the SKA will allow observations of the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization (CD/EoR) in unprecedented detail, both spectrally and spatially. This wealth of information is buried under Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds, which must be removed accurately and precisely in order to reveal the cosmological signal. This problem has been addressed already for the previous generation of radio telescopes, but the application to SKA is different in many aspects. In this chapter we summarise the contributions to the field of foreground removal in the context of high redshift and high sensitivity 21-cm measurements. We use a state-of-the-art simulation of the SKA Phase 1 observations complete with cosmological signal, foregrounds and frequency-dependent instrumental effects to test both parametric and non-parametric foreground removal methods. We compare the recovered cosmological signal using several different statistics and explore one of the most exciting possibilities with the SKA --- imaging of the ionized bubbles. We find that with current methods it is possible to remove the foregrounds with great accuracy and to get impressive power spectra and images of the cosmological signal. The frequency-dependent PSF of the instrument complicates this recovery, so we resort to splitting the observation bandwidth into smaller segments, each of a common resolution. If the foregrounds are allowed a random variation from the smooth power law along the line of sight, methods exploiting the smoothness of foregrounds or a parametrization of their behaviour are challenged much more than non-parametric ones. However, we show that correction techniques can be implemented to restore the performances of parametric approaches, as long as the first-order approximation of a power law stands.},

In both cases, stiffness of linear oscillators as well as linear coupling remains constant, and the system is initially engaged in resonance. The parameters of the systems and forcing are chosen to guarantee autoresonance (AR) with gradually increasing energy in the nonlinear actuator. As this paper demonstrates, forcing with constant frequency generates oscillations with growing energy in the linear chain but in the system excited by forcing with slowly time-dependent frequency energy remains localized on the nonlinear actuator whilst the response of the linear chain is bounded. This means that the systems that seem to be almost identical exhibit different dynamical behavior caused by their different resonance properties.

Using results from two very large cosmological N-body simulations, which increase the available volume at their mass resolution by roughly two orders of magnitude, we robustly determine the halo concentration-mass (c-M) relation over a wide range of masses, employing multiple methods of concentration measurement. We characterize individual halo profiles, as well as stacked profiles, relevant for galaxy-galaxy lensing and next-generation cluster surveys; the redshift range covered is 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 4, with a minimum halo mass of M 200c {$\sim$} 2 \texttimes{} 1011 M {$\odot$}. Despite the complexity of a proper description of a halo (environmental effects, merger history, nonsphericity, relaxation state), when the mass is scaled by the nonlinear mass scale M {$\star$}(z), we find that a simple non-power-law form for the c-M/M {$\star$} relation provides an excellent description of our simulation results across eight decades in M/M {$\star$} and for 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 4. Over the mass range covered, the c-M relation has two asymptotic forms: an approximate power law below a mass threshold M/M {$\star$} {$\sim$} 500-1000, transitioning to a constant value, c 0 {$\sim$} 3 at higher masses. The relaxed halo fraction decreases with mass, transitioning to a constant value of {$\sim$}0.5 above the same mass threshold. We compare Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Einasto fits to stacked profiles in narrow mass bins at different redshifts; as expected, the Einasto profile provides a better description of the simulation results. At cluster scales at low redshift, however, both NFW and Einasto profiles are in very good agreement with the simulation results, consistent with recent weak lensing observations.},

  abstract = {The Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect is a spectral distortion in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), caused due to up-scattering of CMB photons by high energy electron distributions. The largest SZ distortion in the CMB is caused by the hot electrons present in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). However, several other small scale astrophysical processes can also contribute to the SZ distortion in the CMB. Analytic studies have shown that the interstellar (ISM) electron gas of the host galaxy heated by quasar feedback can also cause substantial SZ effect. For successful detection of the quasar feedback signal, the SZ signal from the virialized gas in the host halos of quasars needs to be properly quantified. In this dissertation work, I have estimated the SZ signal from quasar hosts using analytic models of the virialized gas in the ICM/ISM. As a new extension to existing work I have used the measured Halo Occupation Distribution properties of quasar hosts. The results show that the average SZ signal from quasar hosts decreases with redshift. This result is consist what what has been observed by the Planck team.

Photometric redshifts are estimated from ugriz model magnitudes and two Petrosian radii using the artificial neural network package ANNz, taking advantage of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic sample as our training set. The photometric redshifts are then used to determine absolute magnitudes and colours. For all our samples, we estimate the underlying redshift and absolute magnitude distributions using Monte-Carlo resampling. These redshift distributions are used in Limber's equation to obtain spatial correlation function parameters from power law fits to the angular correlation function. We confirm an increase in clustering strength for sub-L* red galaxies compared with \textasciitilde L* red galaxies at small scales in all redshift bins, whereas for the blue population the correlation length is almost independent of luminosity for \textasciitilde L* galaxies and fainter. A linear relation between relative bias and log luminosity is found to hold down to luminosities L\textasciitilde 0.03L*. We find that the redshift dependence of the bias of the L* population can be described by the passive evolution model of Tegmark \& Peebles (1998). A visual inspection of a random sample of our r {$<$} 19.4 sample of SDSS galaxies reveals that about 10 per cent are spurious, with a higher contamination rate towards very faint absolute magnitudes due to over-deblended nearby galaxies. We correct for this contamination in our clustering analysis.},

The comparison is done for two-point (power spectrum and two-point correlation function in real and redshift space), and the three-point clustering statistics (bispectrum and three-point correlation function). The reference catalogues are drawn from the BigMultiDark N-body simulation. Both friend-of-friends (including distinct haloes only) and spherical overdensity (including distinct haloes and subhalos) catalogues have been used with the typical number density of a large volume galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that a proper biasing model is essential for reproducing the power spectrum at quasi-linear and even smaller scales. With respect to various clustering statistics, a methodology based on perturbation theory and a realistic biasing model leads to very good agreement with N-body simulations. However, for the quadrupole of the correlation function or the power spectrum, only the method based on semi-N-body simulation could reach high accuracy (1 per cent level) at small scales, i.e. r {$<$} 25 h-1 Mpc or k {$>$} 0.15 h Mpc-1. Full N-body solutions will remain indispensable to produce reference catalogues. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that the more efficient approximate solvers can reach a few per cent accuracy in terms of clustering statistics at the scales interesting for the large-scale structure analysis. This makes them useful for massive production aimed at covariance studies, to scan large parameter spaces, and to estimate uncertainties in data analysis techniques, such as baryon acoustic oscillation reconstruction, redshift distortion measurements, etc.},

  abstract = {The window function for the Lagrangian halos is often assumed to be a top hat function. We measure the profile of the Lagrangian halo directly and find that it is more extended than a top hat but less diffuse than a Gaussian. We find that the Lagrangian profile can be described well by an effective window composed of a product of a top hat and a Gaussian window in Fourier space. We also check that the same effective window function together with the scale-dependent excursion set bias parameters fits the Lagrangian cross bias parameter in Fourier space well up to \$ k R\_\{Lag\} \textbackslash sim 10 \$, where \$R\_\{Lag\}\$ is the Lagrangian size of the halo. The effective window is simple in Fourier space, and there is also an analytic form in real space, thus there is little work in converting from the usual top hat window to the effective window. With the effective window function, all the spectral moments of the power spectrum are finite, thus we have a unified treatment for computing the spectral moments in peak and excursion set peak theories. When the effective window function is used, the resultant excursion set peak mass function is significantly lower compared to that obtained from the mixed window function approach, and hence this causes the excursion set peak mass function to be appreciably lower than the simulation results for halos of mass \$\textbackslash lesssim 10\^\{14\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}/h \$. We can interpret this deficit as that only part of the low to medium mass halos can arise from peaks.},

In this paper we study the impact of radiation from dark matter (DM) decay and primordial black holes (PBHs) on the 21 cm radiation temperature in the reionization epoch, and impose a constraint on the decaying dark matter and PBH energy injection in the intergalactic medium, which can heat up neutral hydrogen gas and weaken the 21 cm absorption signal. We assume a strong coupling limit in the Lyman-{$\alpha$} background and consider decay channels DM \textrightarrow e\textsuperscript{+}e\textsuperscript{-},{$\gamma$} {$\gamma$} , {$\mu$}\textsuperscript{+}{$\mu$}\textsuperscript{-}, {$\tau$}\textsuperscript{+}{$\tau$}\textsuperscript{-}, b b{\= } and the 1 0\textsuperscript{15 - 17} g mass range for primordial black holes, and require that the heating of the neutral hydrogen does not negate the 21 cm absorption signal. For e\textsuperscript{+}e\textsuperscript{-}, {$\gamma$} {$\gamma$} final states and PBH cases we find strong 21 cm bounds that can be more stringent than the current extragalactic diffuse photon bounds. For the DM \textrightarrow e\textsuperscript{+}e\textsuperscript{-} channel, the lifetime bound is {$\tau$}\textsubscript{DM}\&gt;10\textsuperscript{27} s for sub-GeV dark matter. The bound is {$\tau$}\textsubscript{DM}{$\geq$}10\textsuperscript{26} s for the sub-GeV DM \textrightarrow{$\gamma$} {$\gamma$} channel and reaches 1 0\textsuperscript{27} s for MeV DM. For b b{\= } and {$\mu$}\textsuperscript{+}{$\mu$}\textsuperscript{-} cases, the 21 cm constraint is better than all the existing constraints for m\textsubscript{DM}\&lt;30 GeV where the bound on {$\tau$}\textsubscript{DM}{$\geq$}10\textsuperscript{26} s .

  abstract = {The 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen is a sensitive probe of the Epoch of Reionization, Cosmic Dawn and the Dark Ages. Currently operating radio telescopes have ushered in a data-driven era of 21-cm cosmology, providing the first constraints on the astrophysical properties of sources that drive this signal. However, extracting astrophysical information from the data is highly non-trivial and requires the rapid generation of theoretical templates over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. To this end emulators are often employed, with previous efforts focused on predicting the power spectrum. In this work we introduce 21cmGEM -- the first emulator of the global 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization. The smoothness of the output signal is guaranteed by design. We train neural networks to predict the cosmological signal based on a seven-parameter astrophysical model, using a database of \$\textbackslash sim\$30,000 simulated signals. We test the performance with a set of \$\textbackslash sim\$2,000 simulated signals, showing that the relative error in the prediction has an r.m.s. of 0.0159. The algorithm is efficient, with a running time per parameter set of 0.16 sec. Finally, we use the database of models to check the robustness of relations between the features of the global signal and the astrophysical parameters that we previously reported. In particular, we confirm the prediction that the coordinates of the maxima of the global signal, if measured, can be used to estimate the Ly\{\textbackslash alpha\} intensity and the X-ray intensity at early cosmic times.},

The sample used comprises 221414 galaxies with measured redshifts. We investigate in detail the modelling of the sample selection, improving on previous treatments in a number of respects. A new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection function is determined by dividing the survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for the power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that the input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in detail the possible differences between the galaxy and mass power spectra, and treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are confident that the 2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryon oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Fitting to a CDM model, assuming a primordial ns= 1 spectrum, h= 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the preferred parameters are {$\Omega$}mh= 0.168 +/- 0.016 and a baryon fraction {$\Omega$}b/{$\Omega$}m= 0.185 +/- 0.046 (1{$\sigma$} errors). The value of {$\Omega$}mh is 1{$\sigma$} lower than the 0.20 +/- 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to the signal from the newly sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements in the treatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a density significantly below the standard {$\Omega$}m= 0.3: in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we infer {$\Omega$}m= 0.231 +/- 0.021.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY We discuss the use of a lognormal (LN) random field as a model for the distribution of matter in the Universe. We find a number of reasons why this should be a plausible approximation to the distribution of density irregularities obtained by evolving from Gaussian initial conditions. Unlike straightforward linear theory, the model always has p{$>$}0 but is arbitrarily close to the Gaussian at early times. It has the added advantage that, like the Gaussian model, all its statistical properties can be formulated in terms of one covariance function. A number of interesting and important difficulties with the statistical treatment of density perturbations are revealed by an analysis of this model. In particular, the LN model is not completely specified by its moments. We explain why this could be true for the actual matter field. We also show that the usual method of representing the three-and four-point correlation functions of galaxies, in terms of the parameters Q and R, is not useful for discriminating between Gaussian and non-Gaussian fluctua-tions, and propose better parameterizations in terms of the skewness and kurtosis of the three-and four-point distributions, respectively. Other characteristics of the model, such as topology (genus curves, etc.), multi-fractal behaviour, void probabilities and biasing (behaviour of 'peaks' relative to background fluctuations) are also discussed. The model also provides a way of check-ing the consistency of treatments of large-scale streaming motions in the Universe by allowing us to determine the scale at which linear theory cannot be accurate for both the matter and velocity fields. We discuss a possible model for the number-count distribution of galaxies, based on the LN distribution but allowing for discreteness effects which can make the distribution of log n appear non-Gaussian, and show how to construct Monte-Carlo simulations of point patterns (in one-, two, or three-dimensions) which contain correlations of all orders.},

Despite the great progress that has undoubtedly been made, steps are difficult because of uncertainties in the cosmological parameters, in the modelling of relevant physical processes involved in galaxy formation, and perhaps most fundamentally in the relationship between galaxies and the underlying distribution of matter. For the foreseeable future, therefore, this field will be led by observational developments allowing model parameters to be tuned and, hopefully, particular scenarios falsified. In these lectures I focus on two ingredients in this class of models: (i) the role of galaxy bias in interpreting clustering data; and (ii) the statistical properties of the initial fluctuations. In the later case, I discuss some ideas as to how the standard assumption - that the primordial density fluctuations constitute a Gaussian random field - can be tested using measurements galaxy clustering and the cosmic microwave background.}

We further investigate the effect that the addition of a random component, v\_rms, into the particle velocity field has on the structure of halos. We adopted as a fiducial model the Lambda Warm Dark Matter cosmology with a non-thermal sterile neutrino mass of 0.5 keV. The filtering mass corresponds then to M\_f = 2.6x10\^12 M\_sun/h. Halos of masses close to M\_f were simulated with several million of particles. The results show that, on one hand, the inner density slope of these halos (at radii {$<\sptilde$}0.02 the virial radius Rvir) is systematically steeper than the one corresponding to the NFW fit or to the CDM counterpart. On the other hand, the overall density profile (radii larger than 0.02Rvir) is less curved and less concentrated than the NFW fit, with an outer slope shallower than -3. For simulations with v\_rms, the inner halo density profiles flatten significantly at radii smaller than 2-3 kpc/h ({$<\sptilde$}0.010-0.015Rvir). A constant density core is not detected in our simulations, with the exception of one halo for which the flat core radius is \textasciitilde 1 kpc/h. Nevertheless, if ``cored'' density profiles are used to fit the halo profiles, the inferred core radii are \textasciitilde 0.1-0.8 kpc/h, in rough agreement with theoretical predictions based on phase-space constrains, and on dynamical models of warm gravitational collapse. A reduction of v\_rms by a factor of 3 produces a modest decrease in core radii, less than a factor of 1.5. We discuss the extension of our results into several contexts, for example, to the structure of the cold DM micro-halos at the damping scale of this model.},

  abstract = {The properties of clusters of galaxies offer key insights into the assembly process of structure in the universe. Numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation in a hierarchical, dark matter dominated universe suggest that galaxy cluster concentrations, which are a measure of a halo's central density, decrease gradually with virial mass. However, cluster observations have yet to confirm this correlation. The slopes of the run of measured concentrations with virial mass are often either steeper or flatter than that predicted by simulations. In this work, we present the most complete sample of observed cluster concentrations and masses yet assembled, including new measurements for 10 strong-lensing clusters, thereby more than doubling the existing number of strong-lensing concentration estimates. We fit a power law to the observed concentrations as a function of virial mass, and find that the slope is consistent with the slopes found in simulations, though our normalization factor is higher. Observed lensing concentrations appear to be systematically larger than X-ray concentrations, a more pronounced effect than that found in simulations. We also find that at a fixed mass, the bulk of observed cluster concentrations are distributed lognormally, with the exception of a few anomalously high concentration clusters. We examine the physical processes likely responsible for the discrepancy between lensing and X-ray concentrations, and for the anomalously high concentrations in particular. The forthcoming Millennium simulation results will offer the most comprehensive comparison set to our findings of an observed concentration-mass power law relation.},

We use a simple, nonparametric model, which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities to the maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos (Vmax) by preserving the observed galaxy luminosity function in order to match the halos in simulations with observed galaxies. The novel feature of the model is the use of the maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, Vaccmax, for subhalos, the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. We argue that for subhalos in dissipationless simulations, Vaccmax reflects the luminosity and stellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity at the epoch of observation, Vnowmax. The simulations and our model L-Vmax relation predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of the two-point correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxy clustering in the SDSS data at z\textasciitilde 0 and in the DEEP2 samples at z\textasciitilde 1 over the entire probed range of projected separations, 0.1},

  abstract = {(Summary) Using the conditional luminosity function (CLF) -- the luminosity distribution of galaxies in a dark matter halo -- as the fundamental building block, we present an empirical model for the galaxy distribution. The model predictions are compared with the published luminosity function and clustering statistics from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at low redshifts, and galaxy correlation functions from COMBO-17 survey at a redshift of 0.6, DEEP2 survey at a redshift of unity, and Great Observatories Deep Origins Survey (GOODS) at a redshift around 3. The comparison with statistical measurements allows us to constrain certain parameters related to analytical descriptions that describe the relation between a dark matter halo and its central galaxy luminosity, its satellite galaxy luminosity, and the fraction of early- and late-type galaxies of that halo. The single parameter best constrained by clustering measurements is the total satellite galaxy luminosity averaged over the halo mass distribution probed by the galaxy sample. For SDSS, \$ =(2.1\^\{+0.8\}\_\{-0.4\}) \textbackslash times 10\^\{10\}\$ h\$\{-2\}\$ L\$\_\{\textbackslash sun\}\$, while for GOODS at \$z \textbackslash sim 3\$, \$ {$<$} 2 \textbackslash times 10\^\{11\}\$ h\$\^\{-2\}\$ L\$\_\{\textbackslash sun\}\$. Quantities such as the fraction of satellite galaxies at a given galaxy luminosity are not strongly constrained with SDSS data. We use our CLFs to establish probability distribution of halo mass in which galaxies of a given luminosity could be found either at halo centers or as satellites. Finally, to help establish further properties of the galaxy distribution, we propose the measurement of cross-clustering between galaxies divided into two distinctly different luminosity bins.},

Overall these results indicate that the excursion set formalism in combination with a realistic modeling of the conditions of halo collapse can provide an accurate description of the halo mass distribution.},

We use the extended Press-Schechter formalism to derive the halo mass accretion history from the growth rate of initial density perturbations. We show that the halo mass history is well described by an exponential function of redshift in the high-redshift regime. However, in the low-redshift regime the mass history follows a power law because the growth of density perturbations is halted in the dark energy dominated era due to the accelerated expansion of the Universe. We provide an analytic model that follows the expression \{M(z)=M0(1+z)\^\{af(M0)\}e\^\{-f(M0)z\}\}, where M0 = M(z = 0), a depends on cosmology and f(M0) depends only on the linear matter power spectrum. The analytic model does not rely on calibration against numerical simulations and is suitable for any cosmology. We compare our model with the latest empirical models for the mass accretion history in the literature and find very good agreement. We provide numerical routines for the model online (available at https://bitbucket.org/astroduff/commah).},

The semi-analytic model combines an analytic model for the halo mass accretion history (MAH), based on extended Press-Schechter (EPS) theory, with an empirical relation between concentration and formation time obtained through fits to the results of numerical simulations. Because the semi-analytic model is based on EPS theory, it can be applied to wide ranges in mass, redshift and cosmology. The resulting concentration-mass (c-M) relations are found to agree with the simulations, and because the model applies only to relaxed haloes, they do not exhibit the upturn at high masses or high redshifts found by some recent works. We predict a change of slope in the z \texttildelow{} 0 c-M relation at a mass-scale of 1011 M{$\odot$}. We find that this is due to the change in the functional form of the halo MAH, which goes from being dominated by an exponential (for high-mass haloes) to a power law (for low-mass haloes). During the latter phase, the core radius remains approximately constant, and the concentration grows due to the drop of the background density. We also analyse how the c-M relation predicted by this work affects the power produced by dark matter annihilation, finding that at z = 0 the power is two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained from extrapolating best-fitting c-M relations. We provide fits to the c-M relations as well as numerical routines to compute concentrations and MAHs.\textdagger},

Haloes were resolved down to few 1011 h-1 M{$\odot$}. This allowed us to model galaxies down to absolute magnitude Mr {$<$} -18.9. We used a new hybrid halo occupation distribution and abundance matching technique for galaxy assignment. The catalogue includes the spectral energy distributions of all galaxies. We describe a variety of halo and galaxy clustering applications. We discuss how mass resolution effects can bias the large-scale two-pt clustering amplitude of poorly resolved haloes at the {$\lessequivlnt$}5 per cent level, and their three-pt correlation function. We find a characteristic scale-dependent bias of {$\lessequivlnt$}6 per cent across the BAO feature for haloes well above M{$\star$} \texttildelow{} 1012 h-1 M{$\odot$} and for luminous red galaxy like galaxies. For haloes well below M{$\star$} the scale dependence at 100 h-1 Mpc is {$\lessequivlnt$}2 per cent. Lastly, we discuss the validity of the large-scale Kaiser limit across redshift and departures from it towards non-linear scales. We make the current version of the lightcone halo and galaxy catalogue ({$<$}monospace{$>$}MICECATv1.0{$<$}/monospace{$>$}) publicly available through a dedicated web portal to help develop and exploit the new generation of astronomical surveys.},

  abstract = {Virial mass is used as an estimator for the mass of a dark matter halo. However, the commonly used constant overdensity criterion does not reflect the dynamical structure of haloes. Here, we analyse dark matter cosmological simulations in order to obtain properties of haloes of different masses focusing on the size of the region with zero mean radial velocity. Dark matter inside this region is stationary, and thus the mass of this region is a much better approximation for the virial mass. We call this mass the static mass to distinguish from the commonly used constant overdensity mass. We also study the relation of this static mass with the traditional virial mass, and we find that the matter inside galaxy-sized haloes (M \textasciitilde{} 1012Msolar) is underestimated by the virial mass by nearly a factor of 2. At z \textasciitilde{} 0, the virial mass is close to the static mass for cluster-sized haloes (M \textasciitilde{} 1014Msolar). The same pattern - large haloes having Mvir {$>$} Mstatic - exists at all redshifts, but the transition mass M0 = Mvir = Mstatic decreases dramatically with increasing redshift: M0(z) \textasciitilde{} 3 \texttimes{} 1015h-1Msolar (1 + z)-8.9. When rescaled to the same M0 haloes clearly demonstrate a self-similar behaviour, which in a statistical sense gives a relation between the static and virial mass. To our surprise, we find that the abundance of haloes with a given static mass, i.e. the static mass function, is very accurately fitted by the Press \& Schechter approximation at z = 0, but this approximation breaks at higher redshifts z \textasciitilde = 1. Instead, the virial mass function is well fitted as usual by the Sheth \& Tormen approximation even at z {$<\sptilde$} 2. We find an explanation why the static radius can be two to three times larger as compared with the constant overdensity estimate. The traditional estimate is based on the top-hat model, which assumes a constant density and no rms velocities for the matter before it collapses into a halo. Those assumptions fail for small haloes, which find themselves in an environment where density is falling off well outside the virial radius and random velocities grow due to other haloes. Applying the non-stationary Jeans equation, we find that the role of the pressure gradients is significantly larger for small haloes. At some moment, it gets too large and stops the accretion.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the effects of baryon physics on the halo mass function. The analysis is based on simulations of a cosmological volume. Besides a Dark Matter (DM) only simulation, we also carry out two other hydrodynamical simulations. We identified halos using a spherical overdensity algorithm and their masses are computed at three different overdensities (with respect to the critical one), \$\textbackslash Delta\_c=200\$, 500 and 1500. We find the fractional difference between halo masses in the hydrodynamical and in the DM simulations to be almost constant, at least for halos more massive than \$\textbackslash log (M\_\{\textbackslash Delta\_c\} / \textbackslash hMsun)\textbackslash geq 13.5\$. In this range, mass increase in the hydrodynamical simulations is of about 4-5 per cent at \$\textbackslash Delta\_c=500\$ and \$\textbackslash sim 1\$ - 2 per cent at \$\textbackslash Delta\_c=200\$. Quite interestingly, these differences are nearly the same for both radiative and non-radiative simulations. Such variations of halo masses induce corresponding variations of the halo mass function (HMF). At \$z=0\$, the HMFs for GH and CSF simulations are close to the DM one, with differences of \$\textbackslash mincir 3\$ per cent at \$\textbackslash Delta\_c = 200\$, and \$\textbackslash simeq 7\$ per cent at \$\textbackslash Delta\_c=500\$, with \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ - 20 per cent differences reached at \$\textbackslash Delta\_c = 1500\$. At this higher overdensity, the increase of the HMF for the radiative case is larger by about a factor 2 with respect to the non--radiative case. Assuming a constant mass shift to rescale the HMF from the hydrodynamic to the DM simulations, brings the HMF difference with respect to the DM case to be consistent with zero. Our results have interesting implications to bracket uncertainties in the mass function calibration associated to the uncertain baryon physics, in view of cosmological applications of future large surveys of galaxy clusters.

We embed the standard SO algorithm into a memory-controlled frame program and present the \{\textbackslash bf P\}ython spher\{\textbackslash bf I\}c\{\textbackslash bf A\}l \{\textbackslash bf O\}verdensity code --- \{\textbackslash small PIAO\}. For both FoF and SO halos, the effect of AGN feedback is that of suppressing the HMFs to a level even below that of Dark Matter simulations.

A decrease of the halo masses ratio with respect to the DM case induces the decrease of the HMF in the AGN simulation. The shallower inner density profiles of halos in the AGN simulation witnesses that mass reduction is induced by the sudden displacement of gas induced by thermal AGN feedback.

We compare our model predictions with results of the ultra-high resolution Via Lactea-II N-body simulation, and find superb agreement. We show how our model may be used to predict the distribution of halo properties like concentration.

  abstract = {Observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen (HI) at  high redshifts is an important future probe of reionization. We consider the multifrequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) to quantify the statistics of the HI signal as a joint function of the angular multipole l and frequency separation {$\Delta\nu$}. The signal at two different frequencies is expected to decorrelate as {$\Delta\nu$} is increased, and quantifying this is particularly important in deciding the frequency resolution for future HI observations. This is also expected to play a very crucial role in extracting the signal from foregrounds as the signal is expected to decorrelate much faster than the foregrounds (which are largely continuum sources) with increasing {$\Delta\nu$}. In this paper, we develop formulae relating MAPS to different components of the 3D HI power spectrum taking into account HI peculiar velocities. We show that the flat-sky approximation provides a very good representation over the angular scales of interest, and a final expression which is very simple to calculate and interpret. We present results for z = 10 assuming a neutral hydrogen fraction of 0.6 considering two models for the HI distribution, namely, (i) DM: where HI traces the dark matter and (ii) PR: where the effects of patchy reionization are incorporated through two parameters which are the bubble size and the clustering of the bubble centres relative to the dark matter (bias), respectively. We find that while the DM signal is largely featureless, the PR signal peaks at the angular scales of the individual bubbles where it is Poisson fluctuation dominated, and the signal is considerably enhanced for large bubble size. For most cases of interest at l \textasciitilde{} 100 the signal is uncorrelated beyond {$\Delta\nu$} \textasciitilde{} 1MHz or even less, whereas this occurs around \textasciitilde 0.1MHz at l \textasciitilde{} 103. The {$\Delta\nu$} dependence also carries an imprint of the bubble size and the bias, and is expected to be an important probe of the reionization scenario. Finally, we find that the l range 103-104 is optimum for separating out the cosmological HI signal from the foregrounds, while this will be extremely demanding at l {$<$} 100 where it is necessary to characterize the {$\Delta\nu$} dependence of the foreground MAPS to an accuracy better than 1 per cent.},

This paper investigates the extragalactic point source contamination and how accurately bright sources (gsim1 Jy) must be removed in order to detect 21 cm emission with upcoming radio telescopes such as the Murchison Widefield Array. We consider the residual contamination in 21 cm maps and power spectra due to position errors in the sky model for bright sources, as well as frequency-independent calibration errors. We find that a source position accuracy of 0.1 arcsec will suffice for detection of the H I power spectrum. For calibration errors, 0.05\% accuracy in antenna gain amplitude is required in order to detect the cosmic signal. Both sources of subtraction error produce residuals that are localized to small angular scales, k bottom {$>\sptilde$} 0.05 Mpc-1, in the two-dimensional power spectrum.},

  abstract = {Observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization are considered to constitute the most promising tool to probe that epoch. One of the major goals of the first generation of low-frequency radio telescopes is to measure the 3D 21-cm power spectrum. However, the 21-cm signal could evolve substantially along the line-of-sight (LOS) direction of an observed 3D volume, since the received signal from different planes transverses to the LOS originated from different look-back times and could therefore be statistically different. Using numerical simulations we investigate this so-called light-cone effect on the spherically averaged 3D 21-cm power spectrum. For this version of the power spectrum, we find that the effect mostly 'averages out' and observe a smaller change in the power spectrum compared to the amount of evolution in the mean 21-cm signal and its rms variations along the LOS direction. Nevertheless, changes up to \texttildelow 50 per cent at large scales are possible. In general, the power is enhanced/suppressed at large/small scales when the effect is included. The cross-over mode below/above which the power is enhanced/suppressed moves towards larger scales as reionization proceeds. When considering the 3D power spectrum we find it to be anisotropic at the late stages of reionization and on large scales. The effect is dominated by the evolution of the ionized fraction of hydrogen during reionization and including peculiar velocities hardly changes these conclusions. We present simple analytical models which explain qualitatively all the features we see in the simulations.},

We use numerical as well as seminumerical simulations of reionization in a cubic volume of 607 Mpc across to study this so-called light-cone effect on the H I 21-cm power spectrum. We find that the light-cone effect has the largest impact at two different stages of reionization: one when reionization is \texttildelow 20 per cent and other when it is \texttildelow 80 per cent completed. We find a factor of \texttildelow 4 amplification of the power spectrum at the largest scale available in our simulations. We do not find any significant anisotropy in the 21-cm power spectrum due to the light-cone effect. We argue that for the power spectrum to become anisotropic, the light-cone effect would have to make the ionized bubbles significantly elongated or compressed along the line of sight, which would require extreme reionization scenarios. We also calculate the two-point correlation functions parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight and find them to differ. Finally, we calculate an optimum frequency bandwidth below which the light-cone effect can be neglected when extracting power spectra from observations. We find that if one is willing to accept a 10 per cent error due to the light-cone effect, the optimum frequency bandwidth for k = 0.056 Mpc-1 is \texttildelow 7.5 MHz. For k = 0.15 and 0.41 Mpc-1, the optimum bandwidth is \texttildelow 11 and \texttildelow 16 MHz, respectively.},

Conversely, SIDM simulations using a Monte Carlo N-body technique produce halos with significantly reduced central densities and flatter cores. We introduce a concentration parameter based on enclosed mass that we expect will be straightforward to determine observationally and present predictions for SIDM and CDM. SIDM also produces more spherical halos than CDM, providing possibly the strongest observational constraint on SIDM. In our simulations with SIDM cross sections {$\sigma$}DM\textasciitilde 10-23 to 10-25  cm2 GeV-1, collisions reduce the central density in galaxy halos, with larger cross sections producing lower densities. Simulations in the upper end of this range best match current observations of galaxy properties but are disfavored by cluster simulations of Yoshida and colleagues.

It is based on the idea, inspired by hydrodynamic simulations, that galaxies live in a slowly evolving equilibrium between inflow, outflow and star formation. We argue that this formalism broadly captures the behaviour of galaxy properties evolving in simulations. The resulting equilibrium equations for the star formation rate, gas fraction and metallicity depend on three key free parameters that represent ejective feedback, preventive feedback and reaccretion of ejected material. We schematically describe how these parameters are constrained by models and observations. Galaxies perturbed off the equilibrium relations owing to inflow stochasticity tend to be driven back towards equilibrium, such that deviations in star formation rate at a given mass are correlated with gas fraction and anticorrelated with metallicity. After an early gas accumulation epoch, quiescently star-forming galaxies are expected to be in equilibrium over most of cosmic time. The equilibrium model provides a simple intuitive framework for understanding the cosmic evolution of galaxy properties, and centrally features the cycle of baryons between galaxies and surrounding gas as the driver of galaxy growth.},

  abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large-scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i = 19.9 over 10,000 deg2 to measure BAO to redshifts z {$<$} 0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyalpha forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g {$<$} 22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Lyalpha forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA to an accuracy of 1.0\% at redshifts z = 0.3 and z = 0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8\% and 1.7\% at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Lyalpha forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate DA (z) and H -1(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9\% at z \textasciitilde{} 2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

  abstract = {We compare model results from our semi-analytic merger tree based framework for high-redshift (\$z \textbackslash simeq 5-20\$) galaxy formation against reionization indicators including the Planck electron scattering optical depth (\$\textbackslash tau\_\{es\}\$) and the ionizing photon emissivity (\$\textbackslash dot n\_\{ion\}\$) to constrain the particle mass of Warm Dark Matter (WDM). Our framework traces the Dark Matter (DM) and baryonic assembly of galaxies in 4 DM cosmologies: Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and WDM with a particle mass of \$m\_x = 2.25,3\$ and 5 keV. It includes all the key processes of star formation, supernova feedback, the merger/accretion/ejection driven evolution of gas and stellar mass, and the effect of the ultra-violet background (UVB) created during reionization in photo-evaporating the gas content of galaxies in halos with \$M\_h \textbackslash leq 10\^9 M\_\textbackslash odot\$. We show that current Planck \$\textbackslash tau\_\{es\}\$ values rule out \$m\_x \textbackslash leq 2.5\$ keV WDM, even in the physically unlikely scenario that all ionizing photons produced by these galaxies escape and contribute to reionization (i.e. \$f\_\{esc\}=1\$). With the largest number of UVB-suppressed galaxies, CDM faces a "stalling" of the reionization process with this effect decreasing with the disappearance of small-scale structure with decreasing \$m\_x\$. Finally, we find the bulk of the reionization photons come from galaxies with a halo mass \$M\_h \textbackslash leq 10\^9M\_\textbackslash odot\$, stellar mass \$M\_* \textbackslash leq 10\^7M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and UV magnitude \$ -18 \textbackslash leq M\_\{UV\} \textbackslash leq -13\$ in CDM. The progressive suppression of low-mass halos with decreasing \$m\_x\$ leads to a shift in the "reionization" population to larger (halo and stellar) masses of \$M\_h \textbackslash geq 10\^9M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$M\_* \textbackslash geq 10\^7M\_\textbackslash odot\$ for \$m\_x \textbackslash geq 3\$ keV WDM, although the UV limits effectively remain unchanged.},

Tiny inhomogeneities in the early Universe left their imprint on the microwave background in the form of small anisotropies in its temperature. These anisotropies contain information about basic cosmological parameters, particularly the total energy density and curvature of the Universe. Here we report the first images of resolved structure in the microwave background anisotropies over a significant part of the sky. Maps at four frequencies clearly distinguish the microwave background from foreground emission. We compute the angular power spectrum of the microwave background, and find a peak at Legendre multipole Ipeak = (197 +/- 6), with an amplitude delta T200 = (69 +/- 8) microK. This is consistent with that expected for cold dark matter models in a flat (euclidean) Universe, as favoured by standard inflationary models.},

  abstract = {The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a staged experiment to measure 21 cm emission from the primordial intergalactic medium (IGM) throughout cosmic reionization ( z = 6\textendash 12), and to explore earlier epochs of our Cosmic Dawn ( z {$\sim$} 30). During these epochs, early stars and black holes heated and ionized the IGM, introducing fluctuations in 21 cm emission. HERA is designed to characterize the evolution of the 21 cm power spectrum to constrain the timing and morphology of reionization, the properties of the first galaxies, the evolution of large-scale structure, and the early sources of heating. The full HERA instrument will be a 350-element interferometer in South Africa consisting of 14 m parabolic dishes observing from 50 to 250 MHz. Currently, 19 dishes have been deployed on site and the next 18 are under construction. HERA has been designated as an SKA Precursor instrument. In this paper, we summarize HERA's scientific context and provide forecasts for its key science results. After reviewing the current state of the art in foreground mitigation, we use the delay-spectrum technique to motivate high-level performance requirements for the HERA instrument. Next, we present the HERA instrument design, along with the subsystem specifications that ensure that HERA meets its performance requirements. Finally, we summarize the schedule and status of the project. We conclude by suggesting that, given the realities of foreground contamination, current-generation 21 cm instruments are approaching their sensitivity limits. HERA is designed to bring both the sensitivity and the precision to deliver its primary science on the basis of proven foreground filtering techniques, while developing new subtraction techniques to unlock new capabilities. The result will be a major step toward realizing the widely recognized scientific potential of 21 cm cosmology.},

We consider the 377 cluster candidates identified at z\textbackslash gt 0.25 with a detection significance greater than five, corresponding to the 95\% purity threshold for the survey. We compute constraints on cosmological models using the measured cluster abundance as a function of mass and redshift. We include additional constraints from multi-wavelength observations, including Chandra X-ray data for 82 clusters and a weak lensing-based prior on the normalization of the mass-observable scaling relations. Assuming a spatially flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, we combine the cluster data with a prior on H 0 and find \{{$\sigma$} \}8=0.784+/- 0.039 and \{\{\{{$\Omega$} \}\}\}m=0.289+/- 0.042, with the parameter combination \{{$\sigma$} \}8\{(\{\{\{{$\Omega$} \}\}\}m/0.27)\}0.3=0.797+/- 0.031. These results are in good agreement with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from SPT, WMAP, and Planck, as well as with constraints from other cluster data sets. We also consider several extensions to {$\Lambda$}CDM, including models in which the equation of state of dark energy w, the species-summed neutrino mass, and/or the effective number of relativistic species (\{N\}\{eff\}) are free parameters. When combined with constraints from the Planck CMB, H 0, baryon acoustic oscillation, and SNe, adding the SPT cluster data improves the w constraint by 14\%, to w=-1.023+/- 0.042.},

It appears that the galaxies are on the surfaces of bubble-like structures with diameters of 25-50/h-Mpc. The largest bubble in the survey has a diameter comparable with the most recent estimates of the diameter of the void in Bootes. This topology poses serious challenges for current models for the formation of large-scale structure.

We also investigate how the properties of substructures vary as a function of the mass of the `parent' halo in which they are located. We find that the substructure mass function depends at most weakly on the mass of the parent halo and is well described by a power law. The radial number density profiles of substructures are steeper in low mass haloes than in high-mass haloes. More massive substructures tend to avoid the centres of haloes and are preferentially located in the external regions of their parent haloes. We also study the mass accretion and merging histories of substructures, which we find to be largely independent of environment. We find that a significant fraction of the substructures residing in clusters at the present day were accreted at redshifts z {$<$} 1. This implies that a significant fraction of present-day `passive' cluster galaxies were still outside the cluster progenitor and were more active at z\textasciitilde{} 1.},

  abstract = {While the importance of detecting the Global spectral signatures of the  red-shifted 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen from the very early epochs cannot be overstated, the associated challenges are not limited to isolating the weak signal of interest from the orders of magnitude brighter foregrounds, and extend equally to reliably establishing the origin of the 'apparent' global signal to the very early epochs. This letter, aimed to tackle the latter, proposes a critical test that the measurements of the monopole component of the spectrum of interest should necessarily pass. The criterion is based on a unique correspondence between the intrinsic monopole spectrum and the differential spectrum as an imprint of dipole anisotropy resulting from motion of observer with respect to the rest frame of our source (such as that of our Solar system, interpreted from the dipole anisotropy in CMBR). More importantly, the spectral manifestation of the dipole anisotropy gets 'amplified' by a significant factor, depending on the monopole spectral slopes, rendering it feasible to measure. We describe details of such a test, and illustrate its application with the help of simulations. Such dipole qualifier for the monopole spectrum is expected to pave way for in situ validation of spectral signatures from early epochs, important to presently reported and future detections of EoR signal.},

In the peak model pioneered by Bardeen et al. [Astrophys. J. 304, 15 (1986)ASJOAB0004-637X10.1086/164143], one considers instead density maxima of the initial, Gaussian mass density field as an approximation to the formation site of virialized objects. In this paper, the peak model is extended in two ways to improve its predictive accuracy. First, we derive the two-point correlation function of initial density peaks up to second order and demonstrate that a peak-background split approach can be applied to obtain the k-independent and k-dependent peak bias factors at all orders. Second, we explore the gravitational evolution of the peak correlation function within the Zel'dovich approximation. We show that the local (Lagrangian) bias approach emerges as a special case of the peak model, in which all bias parameters are scale independent and there is no statistical velocity bias. We apply our formulas to study how the Lagrangian peak biasing, the diffusion due to large scale flows, and the mode coupling due to nonlocal interactions affect the scale dependence of bias from small separations up to the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale. For 2{$\sigma$} density peaks collapsing at z=0.3, our model predicts a \texttildelow 5\% residual scale-dependent bias around the acoustic scale that arises mostly from first order Lagrangian peak biasing (as opposed to second order gravity mode coupling). We also search for a scale dependence of bias in the large scale autocorrelation of massive halos extracted from a very large N-body simulation provided by the MICE Collaboration. For halos with mass M{$\greaterequivlnt$}1014M{$\odot$}/h, our measurements demonstrate a scale-dependent bias across the BAO feature which is very well reproduced by a prediction based on the peak model.},

We parametrize the redshift evolution of the ratio between the cosmic GRB rate and star formation rate (SFR) as {$\propto$}(1 + z){$\alpha$}, thereby allowing astrophysical uncertainties to partially mimic the cosmological suppression of structures in WDM models. Using a maximum-likelihood estimator on two different z {$>$} 4 GRB subsamples (including two bursts at z {$>$} 8), we constrain mx {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1.6-1.8 keV at 95 per cent CL, when marginalized over a flat prior in {$\alpha$}. We further estimate that 5 years of a Sino-French space-based multi-band astronomical variable objects monitor like mission would tighten these constraints to mx {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2.3 keV. Our results show that GRBs are a powerful probe of high-redshift structures, providing robust and competitive constraints on mx.},

  abstract = {A dark matter halo is commonly defined as a spherical overdensity of matter with respect to a reference density, such as the critical density or the mean matter density of the universe. Such definitions can lead to a spurious pseudo-evolution of halo mass simply due to redshift evolution of the reference density, even if its physical density profile remains constant over time. We estimate the amount of such pseudo-evolution of mass between z = 1 and 0 for halos identified in a large N-body simulation, and show that it accounts for almost the entire mass evolution of the majority of halos with M\_\{200\textbackslash bar\{{$\rho\rbrace\rbrace$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 10\^\{12\} h\^\{-1\} M\_{$\odot$} and can be a significant fraction of the apparent mass growth even for cluster-sized halos. We estimate the magnitude of the pseudo-evolution assuming that halo density profiles remain static in physical coordinates, and show that this simple model predicts the pseudo-evolution of halos identified in numerical simulations to good accuracy, albeit with significant scatter. We discuss the impact of pseudo-evolution on the evolution of the halo mass function and show that the non-evolution of the low-mass end of the halo mass function is the result of a fortuitous cancellation between pseudo-evolution and the absorption of small halos into larger hosts. We also show that the evolution of the low-mass end of the concentration-mass relation observed in simulations is almost entirely due to the pseudo-evolution of mass. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of the evolution of various scaling relations between the observable properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters and their halo masses.\vphantom{\}\}}},

We show that the relation between concentration, c, and peak height, {$\nu$}, exhibits the smallest deviations from universality if halo masses are defined with respect to the critical density of the universe. These deviations can be explained by the residual dependence of concentration on the local slope of the matter power spectrum, n, which affects both the normalization and shape of the c-{$\nu$} relation. In particular, there is no well-defined floor in the concentration values. Instead, the minimum concentration depends on redshift: at fixed {$\nu$}, halos at higher z experience steeper slopes n, and thus have lower minimum concentrations. We show that the concentrations in our simulations can be accurately described by a universal seven-parameter function of only {$\nu$} and n. This model matches our {$\Lambda$}CDM results to {$<\sptilde$} 5\% accuracy up to z = 6, and matches scale-free {$\Omega$}m = 1 models to {$<\sptilde$} 15\%. The model also reproduces the low concentration values of Earth-mass halos at z {$\approx$} 30, and thus correctly extrapolates over 16 orders of magnitude in halo mass. The predictions of our model differ significantly from all models previously proposed in the literature at high masses and redshifts. Our model is in excellent agreement with recent lensing measurements of cluster concentrations.},

  abstract = {The relation between halo mass, M, and concentration, c, is a critical component in our understanding of the structure of dark matter halos. While numerous models for this relation have been proposed, almost none of them attempt to derive the evolution of the relation analytically. We build on previous efforts to model the c-M relation as a function of physical parameters such as the peak height, {$\nu$}, and the effective power spectrum slope, \{n\}eff\vphantom\{\}, which capture the dependence of c on halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. We present three major improvements over previous models. First, we derive an analytical expression for the c-M relation that is valid under the assumption of pseudo-evolution, i.e., assuming that the density profiles of halos are static in physical coordinates while the definition of their boundary evolves. We find that this ansatz is highly successful in describing the evolution of the low-mass end of the c-M relation. Second, we employ a new physical variable, the effective exponent of linear growth, \{{$\alpha$} \}eff\vphantom\{\}, to parameterize deviations from an Einstein-de Sitter expansion history. Third, we combine an updated definition of \{n\}eff\vphantom\{\} with the additional dependence on \{{$\alpha$} \}eff\vphantom\{\} and propose a phenomenological extension of our analytical framework to include all halo masses. This semianalytical model matches simulated concentrations in both scale-free models and {$\Lambda$}CDM to 5\% accuracy with very few exceptions and differs significantly from all previously proposed models. We present a publicly available code to compute the predictions of our model in the python toolkit COLOSSUS, including updated parameters for the model of Diemer and Kravtsov.},

Advances in mapping and modeling of diffuse and point source foregrounds have improved subtraction accuracy, but no subtraction scheme is perfect. Precisely quantifying the errors and error correlations due to missubtracted foregrounds allows for both the rigorous analysis of the 21 cm power spectrum and for the maximal isolation of the "EoR window" from foreground contamination. We present a method to infer the covariance of foreground residuals from the data itself in contrast to previous attempts at a priori modeling.

  abstract = {21 cm cosmology is a promising new probe of the evolution of visible matter in our universe, especially during the poorly-constrained Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization. However, in order to separate the 21 cm signal from bright astrophysical foregrounds, we need an exquisite understanding of our telescopes so as to avoid adding spectral structure to spectrally-smooth foregrounds. One powerful calibration method relies on repeated simultaneous measurements of the same interferometric baseline to solve for the sky signal and for instrumental parameters simultaneously. However, certain degrees of freedom are not constrained by asserting internal consistency between redundant measurements. In this paper, we review the origin of these "degeneracies" of redundant-baseline calibration, demonstrate how they can source unwanted spectral structure in our measurements, and show how to eliminate that structure. We also generalize redundant calibration to dual-polarization instruments, derive the new degeneracies, and explore the unique challenges to calibration and spectral smoothness presented by a polarized measurement.},

  abstract = {In 21 cm cosmology, precision calibration is key to the separation of the neutral hydrogen signal from bright astrophysical foregrounds. If not properly calibrated, each antenna element's complex gain can impart spectral structure on otherwise spectrally-smooth foregrounds, complicating that statistical separation. The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), an interferometer specialized for 21 cm cosmology and now under construction in South Africa, was designed to be largely calibrated using the self-consistency of repeated measurements of the same interferometric modes. This technique, known as redundant-baseline calibration resolves most of the internal degrees of freedom in the calibration problem. It assumes, however, on antenna elements with identical primary beams placed precisely on a redundant grid. In this work, we review the detailed implementation of the algorithms enabling redundant-baseline calibration and report results with HERA data. We quantify the effects of real-world non-redundancy and how they compare to the idealized scenario in which redundant measurements differ only in their noise realizations. Finally, we study how non-redundancy can produce spurious temporal structure in our calibration solutions---both in data and in simulations---and present strategies for mitigating that structure.},

  abstract = {Fluctuations in the redshifted 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen probe the epoch of reionization. We examine the observability of this signal and the impact of extragalactic foreground radio sources (both extended and point-like). We use cosmological simulations to predict the angular correlation functions of intensity fluctuations due to unresolved radio galaxies, cluster radio haloes and relics and free-free emission from the interstellar and intergalactic medium at the frequencies and angular scales relevant for the proposed 21-cm tomography. In accord with previous findings, the brightness temperature fluctuations due to foreground sources are much larger than those from the primary 21-cm signal at all scales. In particular, diffuse cluster radio emission, which has been previously neglected, provides the most significant foreground contamination. However, we show that the contribution to the angular fluctuations at scales \texttheta{$>\sptilde$} 1 arcmin is dominated by the spatial clustering of bright foreground sources. This excess can be removed if sources above flux levels S{$>\sptilde$} 0.1 mJy (out to redshifts of z\textasciitilde{} 1 and z\textasciitilde{} 2 for diffuse and point sources, respectively) are detected and removed. Hence, efficient source removal may be sufficient to allow the detection of angular fluctuations in the 21-cm emission free of extragalactic foregrounds at \texttheta{$>\sptilde$} 1 arcmin. In addition, the removal of sources above S= 0.1 mJy also reduces the foreground fluctuations to roughly the same level as the 21-cm signal at scales \texttheta{$<\sptilde$} 1 arcmin. This should allow the substraction of the foreground components in frequency space, making it possible to observe in detail the topology and history of reionization.},

There are many ideas for how best to supplement and aid DESI and LSST in order to access some of this remaining information and how surveys beyond Stage IV can fully exploit this regime. These ideas flow to potential projects that could start construction in the 2020's.},

  abstract = {We study the concentration parameters, their mass dependence and redshift evolution, of dark-matter halos in different dark-energy cosmologies with constant and time-variable equation of state, and compare them with ``standard'' {$\Lambda$}CDM and OCDM models. We find that previously proposed algorithms for predicting halo concentrations can be well adapted to dark-energy models. When centred on the analytically expected values, halo concentrations show a log-normal distribution with a uniform standard deviation of \texttildelow 0.2. The dependence of averaged halo concentrations on mass and redshift permits a simple fit of the form (1+z) c=c0 (M/M0){$\alpha$}, with {$\alpha\approx$}-0.1 throughout. We find that the cluster concentration depends on the dark energy equation of state at the cluster formation redshift zcoll through the linear growth factor D+(zcoll). As a simple correction accounting for dark-energy cosmologies, we propose scaling c0 from {$\Lambda$}CDM with the ratio of linear growth factors, c0-{$>$} c0 D+(zcoll)/D+, {$\Lambda$}CDM (zcoll).},

After excluding active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we construct a sample of 22,553 24 \${$\mu\$$}m sources selected from 8.42 deg2 of the Spitzer MIPS AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey of Bo\{\"o\}tes. Mid-infrared imaging allows us to observe galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs), less biased by dust obscuration afflicting the optical bands. We find that the galaxies with the highest SFRs have optical colors that are redder than typical blue cloud galaxies, with many residing within the green valley. At z \{{$>\rbrace$} 0.4 our sample is dominated by luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs, L TIR \{{$>\rbrace$} 1011 L {$\odot$}) and is composed entirely of LIRGs and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, L TIR \{{$>\rbrace$} 1012 L {$\odot$}) at z \{{$>\rbrace$} 0.6. We observe weak clustering of r 0 {$\approx$} 3-6 h -1 Mpc for almost all of our star-forming samples. We find that the clustering and halo mass depend on L TIR at all redshifts, where galaxies with higher L TIR (hence higher SFRs) have stronger clustering. Galaxies with the highest SFRs at each redshift typically reside within dark matter halos of M halo {$\approx$} 1012.9 h -1 M {$\odot$}. This is consistent with a transitional halo mass, above which star formation is largely truncated, although we cannot exclude that ULIRGs reside within higher mass halos. By modeling the clustering evolution of halos, we connect our star-forming galaxy samples to their local descendants.

  abstract = {The recent detection of the "cosmic dawn" redshifted 21 cm signal at 78 MHz by the EDGES experiment differs significantly from theoretical predictions. In particular, the absorption trough is roughly a factor of two stronger than the most optimistic theoretical models. The early interpretations of the origin of this discrepancy fall into two categories. The first is that there is increased cooling of the gas due to interactions with dark matter, while the second is that the background radiation field includes a contribution from a component in addition to the cosmic microwave background. In this paper we examine the feasibility of the second idea using new data from the first station of the Long Wavelength Array. The data span 40 to 80 MHz and provide important constraints on the present-day background in a frequency range where there are few surveys with absolute temperature calibration suitable for measuring the strength of the radio monopole. We find support for a strong, diffuse radio background that was suggested by the ARCARDE 2 results in the 3 to 10 GHz range. We find that this background is well modeled by a power law with a spectral index of \$-\$2.58\$\textbackslash pm\$0.05 and a temperature at the rest frame 21 cm frequency of 603\$\^\{+102\}\_\{-92\}\$ mK.},

Adopting a Baldry-Glazebrook initial mass function we use these relations and apply PEGASE.2 to predict the z = 0 cosmic spectral energy distributions (CSEDs) of spheroids and discs. The model predictions compare favourably to the dust-corrected CSED recently reported by the Galaxy And Mass Assembly team from the far-ultraviolet through to the K band. The model also provides a reasonable fit to the total stellar mass contained within spheroid and disc structures as recently reported by the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue team. Three interesting inferences can be made following our axioms: (1) there is a transition redshift at z {$\approx$} 1.7 at which point the Universe switches from what we refer to as `hot mode evolution' (i.e. spheroid formation/growth via mergers and/or collapse) to what we term `cold mode evolution' (i.e. disc formation/growth via gas infall and minor mergers); (2) there is little or no need for any pre-enrichment prior to the main phase of star formation; (3) in the present Universe mass loss is fairly evenly balanced with star formation holding the integrated stellar mass density close to a constant value. The model provides a simple prediction of the energy output from spheroid and disc projenitors, the build-up of spheroid and disc mass and the mean metallicity enrichment of the Universe.},

The core radius of a typical dark halo is found to be no greater than the softening radius, epsilon = 1.4 kpc. The density profiles can be fitted with an analytical model with an effective power law which varies between -1 in the center to -4 at large radii. The dark halos have circular velocity curves which behave like the circular velocity contribution of the dark component of spiral galaxies inferred from rotation curve decompositions. The halos are strongly triaxial and very flat, with (c/a) = 0.50 and (b/a) = 0.71. There are roughly equal numbers of dark halos with oblate and prolate forms. The distribution of ellipticities in projection for dark halos reaches a maximum at epsilon = 0.5, in contrast to the ellipticity distribution of elliptical galaxies, which peaks at epsilon = 0.2.},

  abstract = {The dissipative infall of gas during the formation of a galaxy modifies the density profile and shape of the dark halo. Gas dissipates energy radiatively and sinks to the center of the dark halo forming the luminous part of a galaxy. The resulting central density enhancement can alter the halo's orbital distribution. We simulate dissipative infall inside of an initially triaxial N-body dark halo by slowly growing a mass distribution modeled by a static potential in the center of the particle distribution. We use both a disk and spherical potential to model the effect of spiral and elliptical galaxies, respectively. The orbits of dark matter particles change in the presence of the central potential. Not only does the central density increase as predicted, but the dark halo transforms from a prolate-triaxial halo (T approximately 0.8) to an oblate-triaxial halo (T approximately 0.5) while approximately preserving the flattening (c/a approximately 0.5). The main implication is that dark halos are rounder and more oblate than previous predictions of purely collisionless simulations with the new constraint that b/a greater than or approximate 0.7. At the same time, the distribution of intrinsic flattenings of dark halos ((c/a) = 0.5, ((c/a)sq)1/2 = 0.15) is preserved during the period of baryonic infall. The oval distortions of disk galaxies should therefore be smaller than original predictions from collisionless dark halos. The predicted distribution of shapes for dark halos from cosmological N-body simulations is in better agreement with distribution of ellipticities of elliptical galaxies if we assume all halos and galaxies become oblate-triaxial in response to dissipation though dark halos are still too flat by about one ellipticity class on average. The observed distribution of kinematic misalignment angles is also consistent with this shape distribution if elliptical galaxies rotate about their intrinsic minor axes.},

We find that significant effects are contributed from the alteration of the halo density profile and concentration, as well as the halo mass function.

Our simulations cover five decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. Because of the increased matter density and power spectrum normalization the concentration-mass relation in the Planck cosmology has a {$\sim$}20 per cent higher normalization at redshift z = 0 compared to Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe cosmology. We confirm that CDM haloes are better described by the Einasto profile; for example, at scales near galaxy half-light radii CDM haloes have significantly steeper density profiles than implied by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) fits. There is a scatter of {$\sim$}0.2 dex in the Einasto shape parameter at fixed halo mass, adding further to the diversity of CDM halo profiles. The evolution of the concentration-mass relation in our simulations is not reproduced by any of the analytic models in the literature. We thus provide a simple fitting formula that accurately describes the evolution between redshifts z = 5 and 0 for both NFW and Einasto fits. Finally, the observed concentrations and halo masses of spiral galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts are in good agreement with our simulations, suggesting only mild halo response to galaxy formation on these scales.},

  abstract = {A host of new low-frequency radio telescopes seek to measure the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen from the early universe. These telescopes have the potential to directly probe star and galaxy formation at redshifts20 {$\greaterequivlnt$} z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 7 but are limited by the dynamic range they can achieve against foreground sources of low-frequency radio emission. Consequently, there is a growing demand for modern, high-fidelity maps of the sky at frequencies below 200 MHz for use in foreground modeling and removal. We describe a new wide-field imaging technique for drift-scanning interferometers: Tikhonov-regularized m -mode analysis imaging. This technique constructs images of the entire sky in a single synthesis imaging step with exact treatment of wide-field effects. We describe how the CLEAN algorithm can be adapted to deconvolve maps generated by m -mode analysis imaging. We demonstrate Tikhonov-regularized m -mode analysis imaging using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) by generating eight new maps of the sky north of {$\delta$} = -30\textdegree{} with 15{${'}$} angular resolution at frequencies evenly spaced between 36.528 and 73.152 MHz and {$\sim$}800 mJy beam -1 thermal noise. These maps are a 10-fold improvement in angular resolution over existing full-sky maps at comparable frequencies, which have angular resolutions {$\geq$}2\textdegree. Each map is constructed exclusively from interferometric observations and does not represent the globally averaged sky brightness. Future improvements will incorporate total power radiometry, improved thermal noise, and improved angular resolution due to the planned expansion of the OVRO-LWA to 2.6 km baselines. These maps serve as a first step on the path to the use of more sophisticated foreground filters in 21 cm cosmology incorporating the measured angular and frequency structure of all foreground contaminants.},

We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction exceeds \$\textbackslash Omega\_0 h\^2 + 0.2\$, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon.

  abstract = {The population of rich galaxy clusters evolves much more rapidly in a universe with critical density than in a universe with low density. Thus, counts of clusters at intermediate redshift offer the possibility of determining the cosmological density parameter, \{OMEGA\}\_0\_ with a minimum of assumptions. We quantify this evolution using the Press-Schechter formalism which we extend to flat cosmological models with a cosmological constant, \{LAMBDA\}\_0\_ = 1 - \{OMEGA\}\_0\_. Using new large N-body simulations, we verify that this formalism accurately predicts the abundance of rich clusters as a function of redshift in various cosmologies. We normalize the models by comparing them with the local abundance of clusters as a function of their X-ray temperature which we rederive from data compiled by Henry \& Arnaud. The resulting values of the rms density fluctuation in spheres of radius 8h\^-1\^ Mpc are {$\sigma\_$}8\_ = (0.52 +/- 0.04)\{OMEGA\}\_0\_\^-0.46+0.10\{OMEGA\}\_0\_\^ if \{LAMBDA\}\_0\_ = and {$\sigma\_$}8\_ = (0.52+/-0.04)\{OMEGA\}\_0\_\^- 0.52+0.13\{OMEGA\}\_0\_\^ if \{LAMBDA\}\_0\_ = 1 - \{OMEGA\}\_0\_. These values depend only weakly, and almost not at all if \{OMEGA\}\_0\_ = 1, on the shape of the power spectrum. We then examine how the distributions of mass, X-ray temperature and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich decrement evolve as a function of \{OMEGA\}\_0\_. We present the expected distributions at z = 0.33 and z = 0.5 and the predicted number counts of the largest clusters, both in space and in projection on the sky. We find that, even at z = 0.33, these distributions depend very strongly on \{OMEGA\}\_0\_ and only weakly on \{LAMBDA\}\_0\_. For example, at this redshift, we expect 15 times as many clusters per comoving volume with M {$>$} 3.5 x 10\^14\^h\^-1\^ M\_sun\_ and 5 times as many clusters with kT {$>$} 5 keV if \{OMEGA\}\_0\_ = 0.3 than if \{OMEGA\}\_0\_ = 1. The splitting in the integrated counts is enhanced by the larger volume element in low-a models. There is therefore a real prospect of estimating \{OMEGA\}\_0\_ from forthcoming surveys of intermediate- redshift clusters that will determine their masses, X-ray temperatures or Sunyaev-Zel'dovich decrements.},

  abstract = {High-resolution N-body simulations are used to examine the power spectrum dependence of the concentration of galaxy-sized dark matter halos. It is found that dark halo concentrations depend on the amplitude of mass fluctuations as well as on the ratio of power between small and virial mass scales. This finding is consistent with the original results of Navarro, Frenk, and White (NFW) and allows their model to be extended to include power spectra substantially different from cold dark matter (CDM). In particular, the single-parameter model presented here fits the concentration dependence on halo mass for truncated power spectra, such as those expected in the warm dark matter scenario, and predicts a stronger redshift dependence for the concentration of CDM halos than proposed by NFW. The latter conclusion confirms recent suggestions by Bullock and coworkers, although this new modeling differs from theirs in detail. These findings imply that observational limits on the concentration, such as those provided by estimates of the dark matter content within individual galaxies, may be used to constrain the amplitude of mass fluctuations on galactic and subgalactic scales. The constraints on {$\Lambda$}CDM models posed by the dark mass within the solar circle in the Milky Way and by the zero point of the Tully-Fisher relation are revisited, with the result that neither data set is clearly incompatible with the ``concordance'' ({$\Omega$}0=0.3, {$\Lambda$}0=0.7, {$\sigma$}8=0.9) {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmogony. This conclusion differs from that reached recently by Navarro and Steinmetz, a disagreement that can be traced to inconsistencies in the normalization of the {$\Lambda$}CDM power spectrum used in that work.},

In this paper, originally published in 1979, we first describe the common solution of retrieving the information from scans made with a large single-dish telescope. However, this is not the only means by which short spacing visibility data can be obtained. We propose an alternative technique that employs a short-baseline interferometer to scan the entire primary beam area. The obvious advantage is that a short-baseline pair from the synthesis instrument can be used, ensuring uniformity in instrumental characteristics. This technique is the basis for the mosaicing algorithms now commonly used in aperture synthesis radio astronomy imaging.},

These simulations are part of a multi-faceted campaign to determine the effectiveness of the dish's design for obtaining a detection of redshifted 21 cm emission from the epoch of reionization. Our simulations show the existence of reflections between HERA's suspended feed and its parabolic dish reflector that fall below -40 dB at 150 ns and, for reasonable impedance matches, have a negligible impact on HERA's ability to constrain EoR parameters. It follows that despite the reflections they introduce, dishes are effective for increasing the sensitivity of EoR experiments at relatively low cost. We find that electromagnetic resonances in the HERA feed's cylindrical skirt, which is intended to reduce cross coupling and beam ellipticity, introduces significant power at large delays (\$-40\$ dB at 200 ns) which can lead to some loss of measurable Fourier modes and a modest reduction in sensitivity. Even in the presence of this structure, we find that the spectral response of the antenna is sufficiently smooth for delay filtering to contain foreground emission at line-of-sight wave numbers below \$k\_\textbackslash parallel \textbackslash lesssim 0.2\$ \$h\$Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$, in the region where the current PAPER experiment operates. Incorporating these results into a Fisher Matrix analysis, we find that the spectral structure observed in our simulations has only a small effect on the tight constraints HERA can achieve on parameters associated with the astrophysics of reionization.},

  abstract = {We present first results from radio observations with the Murchison Widefield Array seeking to constrain the power spectrum of 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations between the redshifts of 11.6 and 17.9 (113 and 75 MHz). Three hours of observations were conducted over two nights with significantly different levels of ionospheric activity. We use these data to assess the impact of systematic errors at low frequency, including the ionosphere and radio-frequency interference, on a power spectrum measurement. We find that after the 1-3 hours of integration presented here, our measurements at the Murchison Radio Observatory are not limited by RFI, even within the FM band, and that the ionosphere does not appear to affect the level of power in the modes that we expect to be sensitive to cosmology. Power spectrum detections, inconsistent with noise, due to fine spectral structure imprinted on the foregrounds by reflections in the signal-chain, occupy the spatial Fourier modes where we would otherwise be most sensitive to the cosmological signal. We are able to reduce this contamination using calibration solutions derived from autocorrelations so that we achieve an sensitivity of \$10\^4\$ mK on comoving scales \$k\textbackslash lesssim 0.5 h\$Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$. This represents the first upper limits on the \$21\$ cm power spectrum fluctuations at redshifts \$12\textbackslash lesssim z \textbackslash lesssim 18\$ but is still limited by calibration systematics. While calibration improvements may allow us to further remove this contamination, our results emphasize that future experiments should consider carefully the existence of and their ability to calibrate out any spectral structure within the EoR window.},

  abstract = {The relative orientation of clusters' major elongation axes and clusters' angular momenta is studied using a large N-body simulation in a box of 500 h-1 Mpc base length for a standard Lambda CDM model. Employing the technique of mark correlation functions, we successfully separated the correlations in the orientation from the well known clustering signal traced by the two-point correlation function. The correlations in the orientation are highly significant for our sample of 3000 clusters. We found an alignment of neighboring clusters, i.e. an enhanced probability of the major elongation axes of neighboring cluster pairs to be in parallel with each other. At 10 h-1 Mpc separation the amplitude of this signal is \textasciitilde{} 10\% above the value expected from random orientations, and it vanishes on scales larger than 15 h-1 Mpc. The ``filamentary'' alignment between clusters' major elongation axes and the lines pointing towards neighboring clusters shows even stronger deviations from random orientation, which can be detected out to scales of 100 h-1 Mpc, both in 2D and 3D analyses. Similarly, strong correlations of the angular momentum were seen. Also a clear signal in the scalar correlation of the absolute value of the angular momentum, the spin parameter and the mass was found. They extend up to 50 h-1 Mpc and have an amplitude of 40\%, 15\%, and 10\% above a random distribution at 10 h-1 Mpc separation, respectively.},

  abstract = {We track the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. The calculation is embedded in the GALFORM semi-analytical model which simulates the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter (CDM) universe. During the evolution of the host galaxy, hot and cold gas are added to the SMBH by flows triggered by halo gas cooling, disc instabilities and galaxy mergers. This builds up the mass and spin of the BH, and the resulting accretion power regulates the gas cooling and subsequent star formation. The accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool disc when the accretion rate exceeds 0.01\textbackslash dot\{M\}\_Edd, and a geometrically thick, radiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below this value. The resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches observations very well, and the mass of the SMBH correlates with the mass of the galaxy bulge as observed. The BH spin distribution depends strongly on whether the gas in any given accretion episode remains in the same plane (prolonged accretion) or whether, due to self-gravity, it fragments into multiple, randomly aligned accretion episodes (chaotic accretion). In the chaotic accretion model there is a clear correlation of spin with SMBH mass. Massive BHs (M{$>$}5\textbackslash times10\^8\textbackslash Msun) are hosted by giant elliptical galaxies and are rapidly spinning, while lower mass BHs are hosted in spiral galaxies and have much lower spin. Using the Blandford-Znajek mechanism for jet production to calculate the jet power, our model is able to reproduce the radio loudness of radio galaxies, LINERS and Seyferts. This is the first confirmation that a CDM galaxy formation model can reproduce the observed phenomenology of AGN.},

We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical uncertainty in the power, and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting scheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that the long-wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian-distributed. We apply the formalism to the updated one-in-six Queen Mary College, Durham, Oxford, and Toronto (QDOT) IRAS redshift survey and compare our results with data from other probes: APM angular correlations and the CfA and the Berkeley 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify the impression from, e.g., counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on large scales as compared to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model with (Omega h) approx. = 0.5. We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with (Omega h) as a free parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best-fitting parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we calculate the distribution of the estimated long-wavelength power. This agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of 10 times the mean. Our results thus reveal no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.},

  abstract = {The recent tentative detection by the EDGES Low-Band antenna of the hydrogen 21-cm line from cosmic dawn, if confirmed, is the first ever signature observed from the epoch of primordial star formation. However, the magnitude and the shape of this signal are incompatible with standard astrophysical predictions, requiring either colder than expected gas, or an excess radio background above the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. In this paper we explore the latter option, investigating possible 21-cm signals in models with a phenomenological excess radio background together with the standard astrophysical modeling. Assuming uniform radiation with a synchrotron-like spectrum existing throughout cosmic history, we show that such a radio background, in addition to explaining the EDGES Low-Band signal, enhances the power spectrum. The signal during cosmic dawn and reionization strongly depends on both the intensity of the radio background and the astrophysical parameters. We verify the broad agreement of our models with the detected feature, including additional constraints from the EDGES High-Band data, high-redshift quasars, and observational limits on the extragalactic radio background. The data imply a lower limit on the star formation efficiency of 2.8\textbackslash\%, an upper limit on the minimum mass of star-forming halos of M\$\_\{\textbackslash rm h\}\textbackslash sim 10\^9\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ at \$z = 17\$, and a lower limit on the excess radio background of 1.9 times the CMB at the 78 MHz cosmic dawn frequency (corresponding to 0.1\textbackslash\% of the CMB at 1.42 GHz). The properties of X-ray sources remain unconstrained. We also show that during the dark ages, such a radio background saturates the 21-cm signal, imprinting a unique signature in both the global signal and the power spectrum.},

These have median redshifts 0.35, 0.55 and 0.68 and, by matching rest-frame optical and radio properties, we construct uniform samples across the three surveys. This paper is concerned with the clustering properties of these samples derived from the angular correlation function. The primary aim is to characterise any evolution in the clustering amplitude of radio galaxies bellow z\textasciitilde 0.68.   We find no evidence for evolution in the large-scale (\textasciitilde 1-50h\^\{-1\}Mpc) clustering amplitude. Our radio galaxy autocorrelations are consistent with previous findings indicating little-to-no evolution in the redshift range 0.68 to 0 (\textasciitilde 6Gyr of time). We also cross correlate radio galaxies with the parent LRG samples to increase the precision of our results and again find no evidence for evolution. Our results are inconsistent with a long-lived model for the clustering evolution that assumes radio sources randomly sample the LRG population. A model where the halo mass is constant with redshift is consistent with the data. This is similar to QSOs that have clustering amplitudes consistent with a single halo mass at all redshifts. Given that the brightest radio sources show stronger evolution in space density compared to fainter radio sources we restrict our samples to include only objects with L{$>$}10\^\{26\}W/Hz and repeat the analysis. Again we find no evidence for evolution in the comoving correlation amplitude. These radio sources appear to inhabit the same mass halos as fainter radio galaxies (\textasciitilde 9x10\^\{13\}h\^\{-1\}M\_\textbackslash odot). These halos are \textasciitilde twice as massive as those of the general LRG population and \textasciitilde 30 times as massive as optical AGN/QSOs.},

  abstract = {In order to attain a statistical description of the evolution of cosmic density fluctuations in agreement with results from the numerical simulations, we introduce a probability conditional formalism (CF) based on a complete inventory of isolated overdense regions in a density random field. This formalism is a useful tool for describing at the same time the mass function (MF) of virialized dark haloes, their mass aggregation histories (MAHs) and merging rates (MRs). The CF focuses on virialized regions in a self-consistent way rather than in mass elements, and it offers an economical description for a variety of random fields. Within the framework of the CF, we confirm that, for a Gaussian field, it is not possible to reproduce at the same time the MF, MAH and MR of haloes, for both a constant and moving barrier. Then, we develop an inductive method for constraining the cumulative conditional probability from a given halo MF description, and thus, using the CF, we calculate the halo MAHs and MRs. By applying this method to the MF measured in numerical simulations by Tinker et al., we find that a reasonable solution, justified by a mass conservation argument, is obtained if a rescaling - increment by \texttildelow 30 per cent - of the virial mass defined in simulations is introduced, and a (slight) deviation from Gaussianity is taken into account. Thus, both the MAH and MR obtained by a Monte Carlo merger tree agree now with the predictions of numerical simulations. We discuss the necessity of rescaling the virial mass in simulations when comparing with analytical approaches on the ground of the matter not accounted as part of the haloes and the halo mass limit due to numerical resolutions in the simulations. Our analysis supports the presence of a diffuse dark matter component that is not taken into account in the measured halo MFs inasmuch as it is not part of the collapsed structures.},

It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

On scales larger than the size of the largest cluster, we present a simple point cluster model in which results depend only on cluster-cluster correlations and on the distribution of the number of objects within a cluster, or cluster occupancy. The point cluster model leads to expressions for moments of galaxy counts in which the volume-averaged moments on large scales approach those of the halo distribution and on smaller scales exhibit hierarchical clustering with amplitudes \$S\_k\$ determined by moments of the occupancy distribution. In this limit, the halo model predictions are purely combinatoric, and have no dependence on halo profile, concentration parameter, or potential asphericity. The full halo model introduces only two additional effects: on large scales, haloes of different mass have different clustering strengths, introducing relative bias parameters; and on the smallest scales, halo structure is resolved and details of the halo profile become important, introducing shape-dependent form factors. Because of differences between discrete and continuous statistics, the hierarchical amplitudes for galaxies and for mass behave differently on small scales even if galaxy number is exactly proportional to mass, a difference that is not necessarily well described in terms of bias.},

Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the matter power spectrum at z {$\sim$} 50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII regions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also discuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an emphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly toward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift applications. Assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted 21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift Universe, complementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional view of structure formation from z {$\sim$} 200 to 6. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The 21-cm background emerging during the cosmological Dark Ages, the era between hydrogen recombination and the formation of the first luminous sources (likely at z \textasciitilde{} 30), is difficult to measure but provides several powerful advantages for these purposes: in addition to the lack of astrophysical contamination, it will allow probes of very small scale structure over a very large volume. Additionally, the 21-cm background is sensitive to the thermal state of the intergalactic hydrogen and therefore probes any exotic processes (including, e.g., dark matter scattering or decay and primordial black holes) during that era. After astrophysical sources have formed, cosmological information can be separated from astrophysical effects on the 21-cm background through methods such as redshift space distortions, joint modeling, and by searching for indirect effects on the astrophysical sources themselves.},

The subhalo populations of different haloes are not scaled copies of each other, but vary systematically with halo properties. On average, the amount of substructure increases with halo mass. At fixed mass, it decreases with halo concentration and with halo formation redshift. These trends are comparable in size to the scatter in subhalo abundance between similar haloes. Averaged over all haloes of given mass, the abundance of low mass subhaloes per unit parent halo mass is independendent of parent mass.It is very similar to the abundance per unit mass of low mass haloes in the universe as a whole, once differing boundary definitions for subhaloes and haloes are accounted for. The radial distribution of subhaloes within their parent haloes is substantially less centrally concentrated than that of the dark matter. It varies at most weakly with the mass(or concentration) of the parent halo and not at all with subhalo mass. It does depend on the criteria used to define the subhalo population considered. About 90\% of present-day subhaloes were accreted after z=1 and about 70\% after z=0.5. Only about 8\% the total mass of all haloes accreted at z=1 survives as bound subhaloes at z=0. For haloes accreted at z=2, the survival mass fraction is just 2\%. Subhaloes seen near the centre of their parent typically were accreted earlier and retain less of their original mass than those seen near the edge. These strong systematics mean that comparison with galaxies in real clusters is only possible if the formation of the luminous component is modelled appropriately.},

Haloes that assembled at high redshift are substantially more clustered than those that assembled more recently. The effect is a smooth function of halo formation time and its amplitude increases with decreasing halo mass. At 1e11 Msun/h the ``oldest'' 10\% of haloes are more than 5 times more strongly correlated than the ``youngest'' 10\%.

  abstract = {We use two very large cosmological simulations to study how the density profiles of relaxed {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter dark haloes depend on redshift and on halo mass. We confirm that these profiles deviate slightly but systematically from the NFW form and are better approximated by the empirical formula, d log{$\rho$}/d logr \textasciitilde{} r{$\alpha$}, first used by Einasto to fit star counts in the Milky Way. The best-fitting value of the additional shape parameter, {$\alpha$}, increases gradually with mass, from {$\alpha$} \textasciitilde{} 0.16 for present-day galaxy haloes to {$\alpha$} \textasciitilde{} 0.3 for the rarest and most massive clusters. Halo concentrations depend only weakly on mass at z = 0, and this dependence weakens further at earlier times. At z \textasciitilde{} 3 the average concentration of relaxed haloes does not vary appreciably over the mass range accessible to our simulations (M {$>\sptilde$} 3 \texttimes{} 1011h-1Msolar). Furthermore, in our biggest simulation, the average concentration of the most massive, relaxed haloes is constant at {$<$}c200{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 3.5-4 for 0 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 3. These results agree well with those of Zhao et al. and support the idea that halo densities reflect the density of the universe at the time they formed, as proposed by Navarro, Frenk \& White. With their original parameters, the NFW prescription overpredicts halo concentrations at high redshift. This shortcoming can be reduced by modifying the definition of halo formation time, although the evolution of the concentrations of Milky Way mass haloes is still not reproduced well. In contrast, the much-used revisions of the NFW prescription by Bullock et al. and Eke, Navarro \& Steinmetz predict a steeper drop in concentration at the highest masses and stronger evolution with redshift than are compatible with our numerical data. Modifying the parameters of these models can reduce the discrepancy at high masses, but the overly rapid redshift evolution remains. These results have important implications for currently planned surveys of distant clusters.},

  abstract = {We present a model for the halo--mass correlation function that  explicitly incorporates halo exclusion. We assume that halos trace mass in a way that can be described using a single scale-independent bias parameter. However, our model exhibits scale dependent biasing due to the impact of halo-exclusion, the use of a ``soft'' (i.e. not infinitely sharp) halo boundary, and differences in the one halo term contributions to \$\textbackslash xi\_\{\textbackslash rm hm\}\$ and \$\textbackslash xi\_\{\textbackslash rm mm\}\$. These features naturally lead us to a redefinition of the halo boundary that lies at the ``by eye'' transition radius from the one--halo to the two--halo term in the halo--mass correlation function. When adopting our proposed definition, our model succeeds in describing the halo--mass correlation function with \$\textbackslash approx 2\textbackslash\%\$ residuals over the radial range \$0.1\textbackslash{} h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\} {$<$} r {$<$} 80\textbackslash{} h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$, and for halo masses in the range \$10\^\{13\}\textbackslash{} h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\} {$<$} M {$<$} 10\^\{15\}\textbackslash{} h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Our proposed halo boundary is related to the splashback radius by a roughly constant multiplicative factor. Taking the 87-percentile as reference we find \$r\_\{\textbackslash rm t\}/R\_\{\textbackslash rm sp\} \textbackslash approx 1.3\$. Surprisingly, our proposed definition results in halo abundances that are well described by the Press-Schechter mass function with \$\textbackslash delta\_\{\textbackslash rm sc\}=1.449\textbackslash pm 0.004\$. The clustering bias parameter is offset from the standard background-split prediction by \$\textbackslash approx 10\textbackslash\%-15\textbackslash\%\$. This level of agreement is comparable to that achieved with more standard halo definitions.},

We present the results of a pilot study of a field centered on 3C196 using LOFAR Low Band (56-70 MHz) observations, where we quantify various wide field and calibration effects such as gain errors, polarized foregrounds, and ionospheric effects. We observe a `pitchfork' structure in the 2D power spectrum of the polarized intensity in delay-baseline space, which leaks into the modes beyond the instrumental horizon (EoR/CD window). We show that this structure largely arises due to strong instrumental polarization leakage (\$\textbackslash sim30\textbackslash\%\$) towards \{Cas\textbackslash,A\} (\$\textbackslash sim21\$ kJy at 81 MHz, brightest source in northern sky), which is far away from primary field of view. We measure an extremely small ionospheric diffractive scale (\$r\_\{\textbackslash text\{diff\}\} \textbackslash approx 430\$ m at 60 MHz) towards \{Cas\textbackslash,A\} resembling pure Kolmogorov turbulence compared to \$r\_\{\textbackslash text\{diff\}\} \textbackslash sim3 - 20\$ km towards zenith at 150 MHz for typical ionospheric conditions. This is one of the smallest diffractive scales ever measured at these frequencies.

  abstract = {Cluster mass profiles are tests of models of structure formation. Only two current observational methods of determining the mass profile, gravitational lensing and the caustic technique, are independent of the assumption of dynamical equilibrium. Both techniques enable determination of the extended mass profile at radii beyond the virial radius. For 19 clusters, we compare the mass profile based on the caustic technique with weak lensing measurements taken from the literature. This comparison offers a test of systematic issues in both techniques. Around the virial radius, the two methods of mass estimation agree to within about 30\%, consistent with the expected errors in the individual techniques. At small radii, the caustic technique overestimates the mass as expected from numerical simulations. The ratio between the lensing profile and the caustic mass profile at these radii suggests that the weak lensing profiles are a good representation of the true mass profile. At radii larger than the virial radius, the lensing mass profile exceeds the caustic mass profile possibly as a result of contamination of the lensing profile by large-scale structures within the lensing kernel. We highlight the case of the closely neighboring clusters MS0906+11 and A750 to illustrate the potential seriousness of contamination of the the weak lensing signal by unrelated structures.}

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

This scaling relation holds for galaxies spanning a luminosity range of 14 magnitudes and the whole Hubble sequence. Here we report that the luminous matter surface density is also constant within one scale-length of the dark halo. This means that the gravitational acceleration generated by the luminous component in galaxies is always the same at this radius. Although the total luminous-to-dark matter ratio is not constant, within one halo scale-length it is constant. Our finding can be interpreted as a close correlation between the enclosed surface densities of luminous and dark matter in galaxies.},

  abstract = {Details of various unknown physical processes during the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization can be extracted from observations of the redshifted 21 cm signal. These observations, however, will be affected by the evolution of the signal along the line of sight which is known as the `light-cone effect'. We model this effect by post-processing a dark matter N-body simulation with an 1D radiative transfer code. We find that the effect is much stronger and dramatic in presence of inhomogeneous heating and Ly {$\alpha$} coupling compared to the case where these processes are not accounted for. One finds increase (decrease) in the spherically averaged power spectrum up to a factor of 3 (0.6) at large scales (k \texttildelow{} 0.05 Mpc- 1) when the light-cone effect is included, though these numbers are highly dependent on the source model. The effect is particularly significant near the peak and dip-like features seen in the power spectrum. The peaks and dips are suppressed and thus the power spectrum can be smoothed out to a large extent if the width of the frequency band used in the experiment is large. We argue that it is important to account for the light-cone effect for any 21-cm signal prediction during cosmic dawn.},

  abstract = {A possible way to study the reionization of cosmic hydrogen is by observing the large ionized regions (bubbles) around bright individual sources, e.g., quasars, using the redshifted 21\textasciitilde cm signal. It has already been shown that matched filter-based methods are not only able to detect the weak 21\textasciitilde cm signal from these bubbles but also aid in constraining their properties. In this work, we extend the previous studies to develop a rigorous Bayesian framework to explore the possibility of constraining the parameters that characterize the bubbles. To check the accuracy with which we can recover the bubble parameters, we apply our method on mock observations appropriate for the upcoming SKA1-low. For a region of size \$\textbackslash gtrsim 50\$ cMpc around a typical quasar at redshift 7, we find that \$\textbackslash sim 20\$ h of integration with SKA1-low will be able to constrain the size and location of the bubbles, as well as the difference in the neutral hydrogen fraction inside and outside the bubble, with \$\textbackslash lesssim 10\textbackslash\%\$ precision. The recovery of the parameters are more precise and the SNR of the detected signal is higher when the bubble sizes are larger and their shapes are close to spherical. Our method can be useful in constraining the properties of the quasar as well as the cosmic reionization history.},

  abstract = {Foreground removal is a challenge for 21-cm tomography of the  high-redshift Universe. We use archival Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data (obtained for completely different astronomical goals) to estimate the foregrounds at a redshift of \texttildelow 1. The statistic we use is the cross power spectrum between two frequencies separated by {$\Delta\nu$} at the angular multipole {$\mathscr{l}$}, or equivalently the multi-frequency angular power spectrum C{$\mathscr{l}$}({$\Delta\nu$}). An earlier measurement of C{$\mathscr{l}$}({$\Delta\nu$}) using these data had revealed the presence of oscillatory patterns along {$\Delta\nu$}, which turned out to be a severe impediment for foreground removal. Using the same data, in this paper we show that it is possible to considerably reduce these oscillations by suppressing the sidelobe response of the primary antenna elements. The suppression works best at the angular multipoles {$\mathscr{l}$} for which there is a dense sampling of the u-v plane. For three angular multipoles {$\mathscr{l}$}= 1405, 1602 and 1876, this sidelobe suppression along with a low order polynomial fitting completely results in residuals of ({$\leq$} 0.02 mK2), consistent with the noise at the 3{$\sigma$} level. Since the polynomial fitting is done after estimation of the power spectrum it can be ensured that the estimation of the H I signal is not biased. The corresponding 99 per cent upper limit on the H I signal is ?, where ? is the mean neutral fraction and b is the bias.},

In order to characterize the weak 21-cm signal, we need to develop imaging techniques that can reconstruct the extended emission very precisely. Here, we present an inversion technique for LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) baselines at the North Celestial Pole (NCP), based on a Bayesian formalism with optimal spatial regularization, which is used to reconstruct the diffuse foreground map directly from the simulated visibility data. We notice that the spatial regularization de-noises the images to a large extent, allowing one to recover the 21-cm power spectrum over a considerable k{$\perp$}-k{$\parallel$} space in the range 0.03 Mpc-1 {$<$} k{$\perp$} {$<$} 0.19 Mpc-1 and 0.14 Mpc-1 {$<$} k{$\parallel$} {$<$} 0.35 Mpc-1 without subtracting the noise power spectrum. We find that, in combination with using generalized morphological component analysis (GMCA), a non-parametric foreground removal technique, we can mostly recover the spherical average power spectrum within 2{$\sigma$} statistical fluctuations for an input Gaussian random root-mean-square noise level of 60 mK in the maps after 600 h of integration over a 10-MHz bandwidth.},

However, the 21-cm tomographic signal is highly non-Gaussian. Therefore there is additional information which is wasted if only the PS is used for parameter recovery. Here we showcase astrophysical parameter recovery directly from 21-cm images, using deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Using a database of 2D images taken from 10,000 21-cm lightcones (each generated from different cosmological initial conditions), we show that a CNN is able to recover parameters describing the first galaxies: (i) Tvir , their minimum host halo virial temperatures (or masses) capable of hosting efficient star formation; (ii) \{\textbackslash zeta\} , their typical ionizing efficiencies; (iii) LX/SFR , their typical soft-band X-ray luminosity to star formation rate; and (iv) E0 , the minimum X-ray energy capable of escaping the galaxy into the IGM. For most of their allowed ranges, log Tvir and log LX/SFR are recovered with {$<$} 1\% uncertainty, while \{\textbackslash zeta\} and E0 are recovered within 10\% uncertainty. Our results are roughly comparable to the accuracy obtained from Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling of the PS with 21CMMC for the two mock observations analyzed previously, although we caution that we do not yet include noise and foreground contaminants in this proof-of-concept study.},

There is a bimodal distribution in half-light radii, with stable star clusters always being smaller than \$\textbackslash sim30\$pc, while stable galaxies are always larger than \$\textbackslash sim120\$pc. We extend the previously known observational relationships and interpret them in terms of a more fundamental pair of intrinsic properties of dark matter itself: dark matter forms cored mass distributions, with a core scale length of greater than about 100pc, and always has a maximum central massdensity with a narrow range. The dark matter in dSph galaxies appears to be clustered such that there is a mean volume mass density within the stellar distribution which has the very low value of about 0.1\$\textbackslash Msun\$ pc\$\^\{-3\}\$ (about 5GeV/c\$\^2\$ cm\$\^\{-3\}\$). All dSphs have velocity dispersions equivalent to circular velocities at the edge of their light distributions of \$\textbackslash sim 15\$km s\$\^\{-1\}\$. In two dSphs there is evidence that the density profile is shallow (cored) in the inner regions, and so far none of the dSphs display kinematics which require the presence of an inner cusp. The maximum central dark matter density derived is model dependent, but is likely to have a mean value (averaged over a volume of radius 10pc) of \$\textbackslash sim0.1\textbackslash Msun\$ pc\$\^\{-3\}\$ (about 5GeV/c\$\^2\$ cm\$\^\{-3\}\$) for our proposed cored dark mass distributions (where it is similar to the mean value), or \$\textbackslash sim60\textbackslash Msun\$ pc\$\^\{-3\}\$ (about 2TeV/c\$\^2\$ cm\$\^\{-3\}\$) if the dark matter density distribution is cusped. Galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos with these properties; smaller systems containing dark matter are not observed.},

Our model extends the halo model formalism, including realistic substructure population within individual dark matter haloes and the scatter of the concentration parameter at fixed halo mass. We consider three prescriptions for the mass-concentration relation and two for the substructure distribution in dark matter haloes. We show that this extension of the halo model mainly increases the predicted power on the small scales and is crucial for properly modelling the cosmological weak-lensing signal due to low-mass haloes. Our extended formalism shows how the halo model approach can be improved in accuracy as one increases the number of ingredients that are calibrated from N-body simulations.},

The model is based on a fit to the formation time distribution, where formation is defined as the earliest time that the main branch of the merger tree contains a fraction f of the final mass M. Our analysis exploits the fact that the median formation time as a function of f is the same as the median of the main progenitor mass distribution as a function of time. When coupled with previous work showing that the concentration c of the final halo is related to the formation time tf associated with f{$\sim$} 0.04, our approach provides a simple algorithm for estimating how the distribution of halo concentrations may be expected to depend on mass, redshift and the expansion history of the background cosmology. We also show that one can predict log10c with a precision of about 0.13 and 0.09 dex if only its mass or both mass and tf are known. Moreover, conversely, one can predict log10tf from mass or c with a precision of 0.12 and 0.09 dex, approximately independent of f. Adding the mass to the c-based estimate does not result in further improvement. These latter results may be useful for studies which seek to compare the age of the stars in the central galaxy in a halo with the time the core was first assembled.},

We first review some of the basic aspects of both Bayesian statistics and Shannon's information theory as applied to the construction of meaningful conceptualization of the natural world. This conceptualization is rendered through the maps we construct of the world based on our limited knowledge of reality. We propose a path from experience to information and physics based on the notion that information is experience that induces change in an Epistemic Agent (EA): the change may be local and focused to a minor aspect of reality or it may be broad and worldview-changing. We illustrate our approach through an analysis of a measure of spatial complexity proposed by one of us called Configuration Entropy (CE), and establish a link between experience at the cognitive level and information content, showing that the CE is a quantitative measure of how much information in spatial-complexity the external world hides from an EA.},

This taken as an axiom, since if it were not true, then we would occupy a preferred position. This paper considers several empirical arguments for radial homogeneity based on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The tightest limits on inhomogeneity on the scale of the horizon are of order ten percent but will improve soon. These limits involve the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies, excitation of low-energy atomic transitions, and the accurately thermal spectrum of the CMB. Weaker limits from primordial nucleosynthesis are discussed briefly.},

  abstract = {When did the first stars form? Did supermassive black holes form at the same time, earlier, or later? One of the great challenges of cosmology today is the study of these first generation objects. The Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) project seeks to detect, in total-power, emission from neutral Hydrogen (21 cm rest wavelength) in the intergalactic medium about 100 million years after the Big Bang (redshifts   20). Detection would deliver the first observational constraints on models of structure formation and the first pockets of star and black holes formation in the Universe. LEDA will develop and integrate by 2013 signal processing instrumentation into the new first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). This comprises a large-N correlator serving all 512 dipole antennas of the LWA1, leveraging a packetized CASPER architecture and combining FPGAs and GPUs for the F and X stages. Iterative calibration and imaging will rely on warped snapshot imaging and be drawn from a GPU-enabled library (cuWARP) that is designed specifically to support wide-field full polarization imaging with fixed dipole arrays. Calibration techniques will include peeling, correction for ionospheric refraction, direction dependent dipole gains, deconvolution via forward modeling, and exploration of pulsar data analysis to improve performance. Accurate calibration and imaging will be crucial requirements for LEDA, necessary to subtract the bright foreground sky and detect the faint neutral Hydrogen signal. From the computational standpoint, LEDA is a O(100) TeraFlop per second challenge that enables a scalable architecture looking toward development of radio arrays requiring power efficient 10 PetaFlop per second performance. Stage two of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA2) is one example.}

To illustrate its utility, we consider two different EoR scenarios, one with a single population of galaxies (with a mass-independent ionizing efficiency) and a second, more general model with two different, feedback-regulated populations (each with mass-dependent ionizing efficiencies). As an example, combining three observations (z=8, 9 and 10) of the 21 cm power spectrum with a conservative noise estimate and uniform model priors, we find that interferometers with specifications like the Low Frequency Array/Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)/Square Kilometre Array 1 (SKA1) can constrain common reionization parameters: the ionizing efficiency (or similarly the escape fraction), the mean free path of ionizing photons and the log of the minimum virial temperature of star-forming haloes to within 45.3/22.0/16.7, 33.5/18.4/17.8 and 6.3/3.3/2.4 per cent, \textasciitilde\$1\textbackslash sigma\$ fractional uncertainty, respectively. Instead, if we optimistically assume that we can perfectly characterize the EoR modelling uncertainties, we can improve on these constraints by up to a factor of \textasciitilde few. Similarly, the fractional uncertainty on the average neutral fraction can be constrained to within \$\textbackslash lesssim10\$ per cent for HERA and SKA1. By studying the resulting impact on astrophysical constraints, 21CMMC can be used to optimize (i) interferometer designs; (ii) foreground cleaning algorithms; (iii) observing strategies; (iv) alternative statistics characterizing the 21 cm signal; and (v) synergies with other observational programs.},

This brings theoretical analysis closer to the tomographic 21-cm observations achievable with next generation interferometers like HERA and the SKA. Parameter recovery can therefore account for modes which evolve with redshift/frequency. Additionally, simulated data can be more easily corrupted to resemble real data. Using the light-cone version of 21CMMC, we quantify the biases in the recovered astrophysical parameters if we use the 21cm power spectrum from the co-evolution approximation to fit a 3D light-cone mock observation. While ignoring the light-cone effect under most assumptions will not significantly bias the recovered astrophysical parameters, it can lead to an underestimation of the associated uncertainty. However significant biases (\$\textbackslash sim\$few -- 10 \$\textbackslash sigma\$) can occur if the 21cm signal evolves rapidly (i.e. the epochs of reionisation and heating overlap significantly) and: (i) foreground removal is very efficient, allowing large physical scales (\$k\textbackslash lesssim0.1\$\textasciitilde Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$) to be used in the analysis or (ii) theoretical modelling is accurate to within \$\textbackslash sim10\$ per cent in the power spectrum amplitude.},

The culmination of ongoing efforts will be the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which will provide tomography of the 21-cm signal from the first billion years of our Universe. Using a galaxy formation model informed by high-\$z\$ luminosity functions, here we forecast the accuracy with which the first phase of SKA-low (SKA1-low) can constrain the properties of the unseen galaxies driving the astrophysics of the EoR and CD. We consider three observing strategies: (i) deep (1000h on a single field); (ii) medium-deep (100hr on 10 independent fields); and (iii) shallow (10hr on 100 independent fields). Using the 21-cm power spectrum as a summary statistic, and conservatively only using the 21-cm signal above the foreground wedge, we predict that all three observing strategies should recover astrophysical parameters to a fractional precision of \$\textbackslash sim 0.1\$ -- 10 per cent. The reionisation history is recovered to an uncertainty of \$\textbackslash Delta z \textbackslash lesssim 0.1\$ (1\$\textbackslash sigma\$) for the bulk of its duration. The medium-deep strategy, balancing thermal noise against cosmic variance, results in the tightest constraints, slightly outperforming the deep strategy. The shallow observational strategy performs the worst, with up to a \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ -- 60 per cent increase in the recovered uncertainty. We note, however, that non-Gaussian summary statistics, tomography, as well as unbiased foreground removal would likely favour the deep strategy.},

  abstract = {Once we have a measurement, how do we extract this information from the signal? This chapter focusses on the inference of the interesting astrophysics and cosmology once we obtain a detection of the 21-cm signal. Essentially, inference of the astrophysics can be broken down into three parts: 1. Characterisation of the observed data: The observed 21-cm signal varies spatially as well as along the line-of-sight (frequency or redshift dimension) to provide a full three dimensional movie of the intergalactic medium in the early Universe. However, we cannot perform a full pixel-by-pixel comparison between theoretical models and the observed signal. Instead, we require a variety of statistical methods to average the observational data in order to be able to better characterise and compare the behaviour of the faint signal. 2. An efficient method to model the 21-cm signal: In order to interpret the observations and understand the astrophysical processes responsible, we must be able to produce physically motivated models capable of replicating the signal. Further, these must be as computationally efficient as possible in order to be able to realistically investigate the 21-cm signal. 3. A robust probabilistic framework to extract the physics: The observed 21-cm signal is dependent on numerous physical processes, which within our models or simulations are described by many unknown parameters. Further, these contain approximations in order to deal with the requisite dynamic range. We must be able to characterise our ignorance in a meaningful way in order to be truly able to infer the astrophysical processes of the epoch of reionisation and cosmic dawn. In this chapter we will focus on each separately, discussing the current state-of-the-art in inferring astrophysical and cosmological information from the 21cm signal.},

Observations indicate that the \$z=0\$ stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass (\$\textbackslash lesssim\$ 0.2 dex) with little dependence on halo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body simulations with observational constraints on the SMHM relation. We find that at the group and cluster scale (\$M\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}{$>$}10\^\{14\}\{M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$) the scatter due purely to hierarchical assembly is \$\textbackslash approx0.16\$ dex, which is comparable to recent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since \$z\textbackslash approx2\$ is driven largely by in-situ growth. We include a model for the in-situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this growth channel of \$0.2\$ dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass that is consistent with observations from \$10\^\{12\}\{M\_\textbackslash odot\}},

The halo occupation distribution framework is adopted to model the measurements on small and intermediate scales (from 0.02 to 60 h-1 Mpc), infer the connection of galaxies to dark matter haloes and interpret the observed trends. We find that luminous red galaxies in CMASS reside in massive haloes of mass M \texttildelow{} 1013-1014 h-1 M{$\odot$} and more luminous galaxies are more clustered and hosted by more massive haloes. The strong small-scale clustering requires a fraction of these galaxies to be satellites in massive haloes, with the fraction at the level of 5-8 per cent and decreasing with luminosity. The characteristic mass of a halo hosting on average one satellite galaxy above a luminosity threshold is about a factor of 8.7 larger than that of a halo hosting a central galaxy above the same threshold. At a fixed luminosity, progressively redder galaxies are more strongly clustered on small scales, which can be explained by having a larger fraction of these galaxies in the form of satellites in massive haloes. Our clustering measurements on scales below 0.4 h-1 Mpc allow us to study the small-scale spatial distribution of satellites inside haloes. While the clustering of luminosity-threshold samples can be well described by a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, that of the reddest galaxies prefers a steeper or more concentrated profile. Finally, we also use galaxy samples of constant number density at different redshifts to study the evolution of luminous red galaxies, and find the clustering to be consistent with passive evolution in the redshift range of 0.5 {$\lessequivlnt$} z {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.6.},

We first present a classification scheme that allows us to distinguish between haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids in the large-scale distribution of matter. This method (which goes beyond a simple measure of the local density) is based on a local-stability criterion for the orbits of test particles and closely relates to the Zel'dovich approximation. Applying this scheme to our simulations we then find that: (i) mass assembly histories and formation redshifts strongly depend on environment for haloes of mass M {$<$} M* (haloes of a given mass tend to be older in clusters and younger in voids) and are independent of it for larger masses (M* here indicates the typical mass scale which is entering the non-linear regime of perturbation growth); (ii) low-mass haloes in clusters are generally less spherical and more prolate than in other regions; (iii) low-mass haloes in clusters have a higher median spin than in filaments and present a more prominent fraction of rapidly spinning objects. We identify recent major mergers as a likely source of this effect. For all these relations, we provide accurate functional fits as a function of halo mass and environment. We also look for correlations between halo-spin directions and the large-scale structures: the strongest effect is seen in sheets where halo spins tend to lie within the plane of symmetry of the mass distribution. Finally, we measure the spatial autocorrelation of spin directions and the cross-correlation between the directions of intrinsic and orbital angular momenta of neighbouring haloes. While the first quantity is always very small, we find that spin-orbit correlations are rather strong especially for low-mass haloes in clusters and high-mass haloes in filaments.},

(b) The haloes with M {$>\sptilde$} M* in filaments spin more rapidly than similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median spin parameters. (c) Haloes with M {$<\sptilde$} M* tend to be younger in voids and older in clusters. (d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie preferentially within the sheet plane independent of halo mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M {$<\sptilde$} M* tend to spin parallel to the filament and higher mass haloes perpendicular to it. For halo masses M {$>\sptilde$} M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with the host filament or the sheet plane, respectively. Such halo-LSS alignments may be of importance in weak lensing analyses of cosmic shear. A question that is opened by our study is why, in the 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 1 redshift regime that we have investigated, the mass scale for gravitational collapse, M*, sets roughly the threshold below which the LSS environment either begins to affect, or reverses, fundamental properties of dark matter haloes.},

  abstract = {We investigate the problem of predicting the halo mass function from the properties of the Lagrangian density field. We focus on a perturbation spectrum with a small-scale cut-off (as in warm dark matter cosmologies). This cut-off results in a strong suppression of low-mass objects, providing additional leverage to rigorously test which perturbations collapse and to what mass. We find that all haloes are consistent with forming near peaks of the initial density field, with a strong correlation between protohalo density and ellipticity. We demonstrate that, while standard excursion set theory with correlated steps completely fails to reproduce the mass function, the inclusion of the peaks constraint leads to the correct number of haloes but significantly underpredicts the masses of low-mass objects (with the predicted halo mass function at low masses behaving like dn/d ln m \texttildelow{} m2/3). This prediction is very robust and cannot be easily altered within the framework of a single collapse barrier. The nature of collapse in the presence of a small-scale cut-off thus reveals that excursion set calculations require a more detailed understanding of the collapse-time of a general ellipsoidal perturbation to predict the ultimate collapsed mass of a peak - a problem that has been hidden in the large abundance of small-scale structure in cold dark matter. We demonstrate how this problem can be resolved within the excursion set framework.},

The large survey area of the SXDS (1sq deg) allows us to measure the angular two-point correlation functions to a wide separation of {$>$}10 arcmin with a good statistical quality. We utilize the halo model prescription for estimating characteristic masses of hosting haloes from the measured large-scale clustering amplitudes. It is found that the hosting halo mass positively correlates with the luminosity of galaxies. Then, adopting the extended Press-Schechter model (EPS), we compute the predictions for the mass evolution of the hosting haloes in the framework of the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology in order to make an evolutionary link between the two galaxy samples at different redshifts and to identify their present-day descendants by letting their haloes evolve forward in time. It is found that, in the view of the mass evolution of hosting haloes in the CDM model, bright LBGs are consistent with being the progenitor of the OPEGs, whereas it is less likely that the LBG population, as a whole, have evolved into the OPEG population. It is also found that the present-day descendants of both the bright LBGs and OPEGs are likely to be located in massive systems such as groups of galaxies or clusters of galaxies. Finally, we estimate the hosting halo mass of local early-type galaxy samples from the 2dF and SDSS based on the halo model and it turns out that their expected characteristic mass of hosting haloes is in good agreement with the EPS predictions for the descendant's mass of both the bright LBGs and OPEGs.},

Existing functionality includes estimators of the power spectrum, 2 and 3-point correlation functions, a Friends-of-Friends grouping algorithm, mock catalog creation via the halo occupation distribution technique, and approximate N-body simulations via the FastPM scheme. The package also provides a set of distributed data containers, insulated from the algorithms themselves, that enable nbodykit to provide a unified treatment of both simulation and observational data sets. nbodykit can be easily deployed in a high performance computing environment, overcoming some of the traditional difficulties of using Python on supercomputers. We provide performance benchmarks illustrating the scalability of the software. The modular, component-based approach of nbodykit allows researchers to easily build complex applications using its tools. The package is extensively documented at http://nbodykit.readthedocs.io, which also includes an interactive set of example recipes for new users to explore. As open-source software, we hope nbodykit provides a common framework for the community to use and develop in confronting the analysis challenges of future LSS surveys.},

  abstract = {We present a catalog of 68 galaxy clusters, of which 19 are new discoveries, detected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) at 148 GHz in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) survey on the celestial equator. With this addition, the ACT collaboration has reported a total of 91 optically confirmed, SZ detected clusters. The 504 square degree survey region includes 270 square degrees of overlap with SDSS Stripe 82, permitting the confirmation of SZ cluster candidates in deep archival optical data. The subsample of 48 clusters within Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90\% complete for M500c {$>$} 4.5 \texttimes{} 1014Msolar and redshifts 0.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.8. While a full suite of matched filters is used to detect the clusters, the sample is studied further through a ''Profile Based Amplitude Analysis'' using a statistic derived from a single filter at a fixed \texttheta 500 = 5farcm9 angular scale. This new approach incorporates the cluster redshift along with prior information on the cluster pressure profile to fix the relationship between the cluster characteristic size (R500) and the integrated Compton parameter (Y500). We adopt a one-parameter family of ''Universal Pressure Profiles'' (UPP) with associated scaling laws, derived from X-ray measurements of nearby clusters, as a baseline model. Three additional models of cluster physics are used to investigate a range of scaling relations beyond the UPP prescription. Assuming a concordance cosmology, the UPP scalings are found to be nearly identical to an adiabatic model, while a model incorporating non-thermal pressure better matches dynamical mass measurements and masses from the South Pole Telescope. A high signal to noise ratio subsample of 15 ACT clusters with complete optical follow-up is used to obtain cosmological constraints. We demonstrate, using fixed scaling relations, how the constraints depend on the assumed gas model if only SZ measurements are used, and show that constraints from SZ data are limited by uncertainty in the scaling relation parameters rather than sample size or measurement uncertainty. We next add in seven clusters from the ACT Southern survey, including their dynamical mass measurements, which are based on galaxy velocity dispersions and thus are independent of the gas physics. In combination with WMAP7 these data simultaneously constrain the scaling relation and cosmological parameters, yielding 68\% confidence ranges described by {$\sigma$}8 = 0.829 {$\pm$} 0.024 and {$\Omega$}m = 0.292 {$\pm$} 0.025.. We consider these results in the context of constraints from CMB and other cluster studies. The constraints arise mainly due to the inclusion of the dynamical mass information and do not require strong priors on the SZ scaling relation parameters. The results include marginalization over a 15\% bias in dynamical masses relative to the true halo mass. In an extension to {$\Lambda$}CDM that incorporates non-zero neutrino mass density, we combine our data with WMAP7, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, and Hubble constant measurements to constrain the sum of the neutrino mass species to be {$\sum\nu$}m{$\nu$} {$<$} 0.29 eV (95\% confidence limit).},

These simulations extend the numerical convergence study presented in Paper I of this series, and demonstrate that the mass profile of CDM galaxy haloes can be robustly estimated beyond a minimum converged radius of order rconv\textasciitilde{} 1h-1 kpc in our highest-resolution runs. The density profiles of simulated haloes become progressively shallower from the virial radius inwards, and show no sign of approaching a well-defined power law near the centre. At rconv, the density profile is steeper than expected from the formula proposed by Navarro, Frenk \& White, which has a {$\rho\sptilde$}r-1 cusp, but significantly shallower than the steeply divergent {$\rho\sptilde$}r-1.5 cusp proposed by Moore et al. We perform a direct comparison of the spherically averaged dark matter circular velocity profiles with H{$\alpha$} rotation curves of a sample of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. We find that most galaxies in the sample (about 70 per cent) have rotation curves that are consistent with the structure of CDM haloes. Of the remainder, 20 per cent have rotation curves which cannot be fit by any smooth fitting function with few free parameters, and 10 per cent are inconsistent with CDM haloes. However, the latter consist mostly of rotation curves that do not extend to large enough radii to accurately determine their shapes and maximum velocities. We conclude that the inner structure of CDM haloes is not manifestly inconsistent with the rotation curves of LSB galaxies.},

  abstract = {We use a set of cosmological N-body simulations to investigate the structural shape of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (CDM) haloes. Unlike most previous work on the subject - which dealt with shapes as measured by the inertia tensor - we focus here on the shape of the gravitational potential, a quantity more directly relevant to comparison with observational probes. A further advantage is that the potential is less sensitive to the effects of substructure and, as a consequence, the isopotential surfaces are typically smooth and well approximated by concentric ellipsoids. Our main result is that the asphericity of the potential increases rapidly towards the centre of the halo. The radial trend is more pronounced than expected from constant flattening in the mass distribution, and reflects a strong tendency for dark matter haloes to become increasingly aspherical inwards. Near the centre the halo potential is approximately prolate on average [(c/a)0 = 0.72 +/- 0.04,(b/a)0 = 0.78 +/- 0.08], but it becomes less axisymmetric and more spherical in the outer regions. The principal axes of the isopotential surfaces remain well aligned, and in most haloes the angular momentum tends to be parallel to the minor axis and perpendicular to the major axis. This suggests that galactic discs may form in a plane where the potential is elliptical and where its ellipticity varies rapidly with radius. This can result in significant deviations from circular motion in systems such as low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, even for relatively minor deviations from circular symmetry. Simulated long-slit rotation curves often appear similar to those of LSBs cited as evidence for constant density `cores'. This suggests that taking into account the 3D shape of the dark mass distribution might help to reconcile such evidence with the cuspy mass profile of CDM haloes.},

Both at z = 0 and at z = 0.76 these cross-correlations are surprisingly well fitted if the inner region is approximated by a density profile of NFW or Einasto form, the outer region by a biased version of the linear mass autocorrelation function, and the maximum of the two is adopted where they are comparable. We use a simulation of galaxy formation within the MS to explore how these results are reflected in cross-correlations between galaxies and mass. These are directly observable through galaxy-galaxy lensing. Here also we find that simple models can represent the simulation results remarkably well, typically to {$<\sptilde$}10 per cent. Such models can be used to extend our results to other redshifts, to cosmologies with other parameters, and to other assumptions about how galaxies populate dark haloes. Our galaxy formation simulation already reproduces current galaxy-galaxy lensing data quite well. The characteristic features predicted in the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal should provide a strong test of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology as well as a route to understanding how galaxies form within it.},

  abstract = {The primary challenge for experiments measuring the neutral hydrogen  power spectrum from the epoch of reionization (EoR) is mode-mixing effects, where foregrounds from very bright astrophysical sources interact with the instrument to contaminate the EoR signal. In this paper, we identify a new type of mode mixing that occurs when measurements from non-identical baselines are combined for increased power spectrum sensitivity. This multi-baseline effect dominates the mode-mixing power in our simulations and can contaminate the EoR window, an area in Fourier space previously identified to be relatively free of foreground power.},

  abstract = {There are several standard formats for astronomical interferometric data, but converting between them in a stable and repeatable way has historically been very challenging. This is partly because of subtle assumptions in the implementations of the formats and the complexity of the mathematical relationships between the different formats (e.g. drift mode vs phased data) and partly because data analysis for individual telescopes typically used just one of the standards along with the associated analysis code. New low frequency instruments (e.g. MWA (http://www.mwatelescope.org/), PAPER (http://eor.berkeley.edu/), HERA (http://reionization.org/)), have required custom analysis and simulation software that rely on a range of different file formats. pyuvdata was designed to facilitate interoperability between these instruments and codes by providing high quality, well documented conversion routines as well as an interface to interact with interferometric data and simulations directly in python. pyuvdata currently supports reading and writing uvfits (Greisen 2016) and miriad (Sault, Teuben, and Wright 1995) files and reading FHD (Sullivan et al. 2012) visibility save files.},

Radio source counts continue to be an area of interest, used to study the relative populations of galaxy types in the Universe (as well as investigate any cosmological evolution in luminosity functions). They are a vital consideration for determining how source confusion may limit the depth of a radio interferometer observation, and are essential for characterising extragalactic foregrounds in CMB experiments. There is currently no consensus as to the relative populations of the faintest (sub-mJy) source types, where the counts turn-up. Most of the source counts in this regime are gathered from multiple observations that each use a deep, single pointing with a radio interferometer. These independent measurements show large amounts of scatter (factors \textasciitilde{} a few) that significantly exceeds their stated uncertainties. In this article we use a simulation of the extragalactic radio continuum emission to assess the level at which sample variance may be the cause of the scatter. We find that the scatter induced by sample variance in the simulated counts decreases towards lower flux density bins as the raw source counts increase. The field-to-field variations are significant, and could even be the sole cause at {$>$}100 \{\textbackslash mu\}Jy. We present a method for evaluating the flux density limit that a survey must reach in order to reduce the count uncertainty induced by sample variance to a specific value. We also derive a method for correcting Poisson errors on counts in order to include the uncertainties due to the cosmological clustering of sources. An empirical constraint on the effect of sample variance at these low luminosities is unlikely to arise until the completion of new large-scale surveys with next-generation radio telescopes.},

Furthermore we find that making reasonable changes to the analysis process, e.g., altering the description of the foregrounds or changing the range of frequencies included in the analysis, gives markedly different results for the properties of the absorption profile. We can in fact get what appears to be a satisfactory fit to the data without any absorption feature if there is a periodic feature with an amplitude of \textasciitilde 0.05 K present in the data. We believe that this calls into question the interpretation of these data as an unambiguous detection of the cosmological 21-cm absorption signature.},

The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, {$\Omega$} b h 2, {$\Omega$} c h 2, and {$\Omega\Lambda$}, are each determined to a precision of \textasciitilde 1.5\%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3\%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5{$\sigma$} level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional {$\Lambda$}CDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their {$\Lambda$}CDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r {$<$} 0.13 (95\% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to \textbackslash Omega \_k = -0.0027\^\{+ 0.0039\}\_\{- 0.0038\}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to {$\sum$}m {$\nu$} {$<$} 0.44 eV (95\% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 {$\pm$} 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

Merger rates have been calculated for masses in the range \$10\^\{10\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\textbackslash mathrm\{h\}\^\{-1\}\$ to \$10\^\{14\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\textbackslash mathrm\{h\}\^\{-1\}\$ and for redshifts \$z\$ in the range 0 to 3 and they have been compared with merger rates that have been proposed by other authors as fits to the results of N-body simulations. The detailed comparison presented here shows that the agreement between the analytical models and N-body simulations depends crucially on the mass of the descendant halo. For some range of masses and redshifts either SC or EC models approximate satisfactory the results of N-body simulations but for other cases both models are less satisfactory or even bad approximations. We showed, by studying the parameters of the problem that a disagreement --if it appears-- does not depend on the values of the parameters but on the kind of the particular solution used for the distribution of progenitors or on the nature of EPS methods. Further studies could help to improve our understanding about the physical processes during the formation of dark matter haloes.},

Here, a walk is called left-continuous when its steps are bounded from below by -1. We start by introducing some notation. Let Pk denote the law of a random walk starting at k {$\geq$} 0, let \{Yi\}{$\infty$}i=1 be the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steps of the random walk, let Sn = k + Y1 + {$\cdot$}  {$\cdot$}  {$\cdot$} + Yn be the position of the random walk starting at k after n steps, and let T0 = inf\{n: Sn = 0\} (1) denote the walk's first hitting time of the origin. Clearly, T0 = 0 when the walker starts at the origin. Then, the hitting time theorem is the following result: Theorem 1 (Hitting time theorem).

We use a large-scale, high-resolution N-body simulation to model the matter distribution in a light cone containing \textasciitilde 106 clusters of mass M{$>$}2\texttimes 1013 h-1 Msolar out to redshifts of z=3. The best-fit three-dimensional ellipsoid of the mass distribution is determined for each cluster, and the results are used to analyze cluster ellipticities as a function of mass, radius, and redshift. A similar analysis is done in two dimensions in order to allow direct comparisons with future observations. Cluster ellipticities are determined within different radii, including 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 h-1 comoving Mpc. We find strong cluster ellipticities: {$<\varepsilon>\equiv<$}1-a2/a1{$>\sptilde$}0.3-0.5. The mean ellipticity increases with redshift from {$<\varepsilon>\sptilde$}0.3 at z=0 to {$<\varepsilon>\sptilde$}0.5 at z=3 for both three-dimensional and two-dimensional ellipticities; the evolution is well fitted by {$<\varepsilon>$}=0.33+0.05z. The ellipticities increase with cluster mass and with cluster radius; the main cluster body is more elliptical than the cluster cores, but the increase of ellipticities with redshift is preserved. Using the fitted cluster ellipsoids, we determine the alignment of clusters as a function of their separation. We find strong alignment of clusters for separations {$<\sptilde$}100 h-1 Mpc; the alignment increases with decreasing separation and with increasing redshift. The evolution of clusters from highly aligned and elongated systems at early times to lower alignment and elongation at present reflects the hierarchical and filamentary nature of structure formation. These measures of cluster ellipticity and alignment will provide a new test of the current cosmological model when compared with upcoming cluster surveys.},

Our sample, which we denote MGS, covers 6813 deg2 with an effective redshift zeff = 0.15 and is described in our companion paper (Paper I), which concentrates on baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. In order to validate the fitting methods used in both papers, and derive errors, we create and analyse 1000 mock catalogues using a new algorithm called PICOLA to generate accurate dark matter fields. Haloes are then selected using a friends-of-friends algorithm, and populated with galaxies using a halo-occupation distribution fitted to the data. Using errors derived from these mocks, we fit a model to the monopole and quadrupole moments of the MGS correlation function. If we assume no Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect (valid at z = 0.15 for any smooth model of the expansion history), we measure the amplitude of the velocity field, f{$\sigma$}8, at z = 0.15 to be 0.49\_\{-0.14\}\^\{+0.15\}. We also measure f{$\sigma$}8 including the AP effect. This latter measurement can be freely combined with recent cosmic microwave background results to constrain the growth index of fluctuations, {$\gamma$}. Assuming a background {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmology and combining with current BAO data, we find {$\gamma$} = 0.64 {$\pm$} 0.09, which is consistent with the prediction of general relativity ({$\gamma$} {$\approx$} 0.55), though with a slight preference for higher {$\gamma$} and hence models with weaker gravitational interactions.},

  abstract = {We present a general statistical framework for describing the effect of sample variance in the number counts of virialized objects and examine its effect on cosmological parameter estimation. Specifically, we consider effects of sample variance on the power spectrum normalization and properties of dark energy extracted from current and future local and high-redshift samples of clusters. We show that for future surveys that probe ever lower cluster masses and temperatures, sample variance is generally comparable to or greater than shot noise and thus cannot be neglected in deriving precision cosmological constraints. For example, sample variance is usually more important than shot variance in constraints on the equation of state of the dark energy from z {$<$} 1 clusters. Although we found that effects of sample variance on the sigma\_8-Omega\_m constraints from the current flux and temperature limited X-ray surveys are not significant, they may be important for future studies utilizing the shape of the temperature function to break the sigma\_8-Omega\_m degeneracy. We also present numerical tests clarifying the definition of cluster mass employed in cosmological modelling and accurate fitting formula for the conversion between different definitions of halo mass (e.g., virial vs. fixed overdensity).},

  abstract = {Using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the low-frequency Square Kilometre Array (SKA1 LOW) precursor located in Western Australia, we have completed the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, and present the resulting extragalactic catalogue, utilising the first year of observations. The catalogue covers 24,831 square degrees, over declinations south of \$+30\^\textbackslash circ\$ and Galactic latitudes outside \$10\^\textbackslash circ\$ of the Galactic plane, excluding some areas such as the Magellanic Clouds. It contains 307,455 radio sources with 20 separate flux density measurements across 72--231MHz, selected from a time- and frequency- integrated image centred at 200MHz, with a resolution of \$\textbackslash approx 2\$'. Over the catalogued region, we estimate that the catalogue is 90\% complete at 170mJy, and 50\% complete at 55mJy, and large areas are complete at even lower flux density levels. Its reliability is 99.97\% above the detection threshold of \$5\textbackslash sigma\$, which itself is typically 50mJy. These observations constitute the widest fractional bandwidth and largest sky area survey at radio frequencies to date, and calibrate the low frequency flux density scale of the southern sky to better than 10\%. This paper presents details of the flagging, imaging, mosaicking, and source extraction/characterisation, as well as estimates of the completeness and reliability. All source measurements and images are available online (http://www.mwatelescope.org/science/gleam-survey). This is the first in a series of publications describing the GLEAM survey results.},

  abstract = {Our goal is to find a minimalistic model describing the luminosity function and large-scale clustering bias of the X-ray selected AGN in the general framework of the concordance LCDM model. We assume that a simple population-averaged scaling relation between the AGN X-ray luminosity L\_X and the host dark matter halo mass M\_h exists. With such a relation, the AGN X-ray luminosity function can be computed from the halo mass function. Using for the latter the concordance LCDM halo mass function, we obtain the M\_h-L\_X relation required to match the redshift dependent AGN X-ray luminosity function known from X-ray observations. We find that with a simple power law scaling M\_h \textbackslash propto L\_X\^\textbackslash Gamma(z), our model can successfully reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity function. Furthermore, we automatically obtain predictions for the large-scale AGN clustering amplitudes and their dependence on the luminosity and redshift, which seem to be compatible with AGN clustering measurements. Our model also includes the redshift-dependent AGN duty cycle which peaks at the redshift z \textasciitilde{} 1 and its peak value is consistent with unity, suggesting that on average there is no more than one AGN per dark matter halo. For a typical X-ray selected AGN at z \textasciitilde{} 1, our best-fit M\_h-L\_X scaling implies low Eddington ratio L\_X/L\_Edd \textasciitilde{} 10\^\{-4\}-10\^\{-3\} and correspondingly large mass growth e-folding times, suggesting that the typical X-ray AGN are dominantly fueled via relatively inefficient 'hot-halo' accretion mode.},

Based on analytic continuation, rapidly converging quadrature rules are derived for a general class of oscillatory integrals with an analytic integrand. The accuracy of the quadrature increases both for the case of a fixed number of points and increasing frequency, and for the case of an increasing number of points and fixed frequency. These results are then used to obtain quadrature rules for more general oscillatory integrals, i.e., for functions that exhibit some smoothness but that are not analytic. The approach described in this paper is related to the steepest descent method, but it does not employ asymptotic expansions. It can be used for small or moderate frequencies as well as for very high frequencies. The approach is compared with the oscillatory integration techniques recently developed by Iserles and N\o rsett.},

It has previously been suspected that dwarf galaxies may not be isotropically distributed around our Galaxy, because several are correlated with streams of H\,I emission, and may form coplanar groups. These suspicions are supported by recent analyses. It has been claimed that the apparently planar distribution of satellites is not predicted within standard cosmology, and cannot simply represent a memory of past coherent accretion. However, other studies dispute this conclusion. Here we report the existence of a planar subgroup of satellites in the Andromeda galaxy (M\,31), comprising about half of the population. The structure is at least 400\,kiloparsecs in diameter, but also extremely thin, with a perpendicular scatter of less than 14.1\,kiloparsecs. Radial velocity measurements reveal that the satellites in this structure have the same sense of rotation about their host. This shows conclusively that substantial numbers of dwarf satellite galaxies share the same dynamical orbital properties and direction of angular momentum. Intriguingly, the plane we identify is approximately aligned with the pole of the Milky Way's disk and with the vector between the Milky Way and Andromeda.},

We provide a description of the observations, data reduction and source catalog construction. From our single pointing GMRT observation of \textasciitilde 12 hours we obtain a high-resolution (26" x 22") image of \textasciitilde 11.3 square degrees, fully covering the Bootes field region and beyond. The image has a central noise level of \textasciitilde 1.0 mJy/beam, which rises to 2.0-2.5 mJy/beam at the field edge, placing it amongst the deepest \textasciitilde 150 MHz surveys to date. The catalog of 598 extracted sources is estimated to be \textasciitilde 92 percent complete for {$>$}10 mJy sources, while the estimated contamination with false detections is {$<$}1 percent. The low RMS position uncertainty of 1.24" facilitates accurate matching against catalogs at optical, infrared and other wavelengths. Differential source counts are determined down to {$<\sptilde$}10 mJy. There is no evidence for flattening of the counts towards lower flux densities as observed in deep radio surveys at higher frequencies, suggesting that our catalog is dominated by the classical radio-loud AGN population that explains the counts at higher flux densities. Combination with available deep 1.4 GHz observations yields an accurate determination of spectral indices for 417 sources down to the lowest 153 MHz flux densities, of which 16 have ultra-steep spectra with spectral indices below -1.3. We confirm that flattening of the median spectral index towards low flux densities also occurs at this frequency. The detection fraction of the radio sources in NIR Ks-band is found to drop with radio spectral index, which is in agreement with the known correlation between spectral index and redshift for brighter radio sources.},

We present basic statistics, dark matter power spectra and halo (subhalo) mass function, to demonstrate the huge dynamic range and superb statistics of the Uchuu simulations. From the analysis of the evolution of the power spectra we conclude that our simulations are accurate enough from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations up to very small scales. We also provide parameters of a mass-concentration model, which describes the evolution of halo concentrations, that reproduces our simulation data within 5\% error.

  abstract = {(Abridged) We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). A vast array of science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach\textbackslash '\{o\}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg\$\^2\$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera. This system can image about 10,000 square degrees of sky in three clear nights using pairs of 15-second exposures twice per night, with typical 5\$\textbackslash sigma\$ depth for point sources of \$r\textbackslash sim24.5\$ (AB). The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg\$\^2\$ with \$\textbackslash delta{$<$}+34.5\^\textbackslash circ\$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, \$ugrizy\$, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\textbackslash\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg\$\^2\$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to \$r\textbackslash sim27.5\$. The remaining 10\textbackslash\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a Very Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products, including a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion objects, available to the public and scientists around the world.},

In this paper, we compare the outputs of multiple pipelines for the purpose of validating statistical limits cosmological hydrogen at redshifts between 6 and 12. Multiple, independent, data calibration and reduction pipelines are used to make power spectrum limits on a fiducial night of data. Comparing the outputs of imaging and power spectrum stages highlights differences in calibration, foreground subtraction and power spectrum calculation. The power spectra found using these different methods span a space defined by the various tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and systematic control. Lessons learned from comparing the pipelines range from the algorithmic to the prosaically mundane; all demonstrate the many pitfalls of neglecting reproducibility. We briefly discuss the way these different methods attempt to handle the question of evaluating a significant detection in the presence of foregrounds.},

These instruments, including CHIME in the sub-meter and HERA in the meter bands, are wide-field arrays with multiple-degree beams, typically operating in transit mode. Accurate knowledge of their primary beams is critical for separation of bright foregrounds from the desired cosmological signals, but difficult to achieve through astronomical observations alone. Previous beam calibration work at low frequencies has focused on model verification and does not address the need of 21 cm experiments for routine beam mapping, to the horizon, of the as-built array. We describe the design and methodology of a drone-mounted calibrator, the External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories (ECHO), that aims to address this need. We report on a first set of trials to calibrate low-frequency dipoles at 137 MHz and compare ECHO measurements to an established beam-mapping system based on transmissions from the Orbcomm satellite constellation. We create beam maps of two dipoles at a 9\textdegree{} resolution and find sample noise ranging from 1\% at the zenith to 100\% in the far sidelobes. Assuming this sample noise represents the error in the measurement, the higher end of this range is not yet consistent with the desired requirement but is an improvement on Orbcomm. The overall performance of ECHO suggests that the desired precision and angular coverage is achievable in practice with modest improvements. We identify the main sources of systematic error and uncertainty in our measurements and describe the steps needed to overcome them.},

Concentration, age, substructure, mass, sphericity and relaxedness can be considered a single family of parameters, albeit with substantial scatter. In contrast, spin, environment and triaxiality are more independent, although spin does correlate strongly with substructure and both spin and triaxiality correlate substantially with concentration. Although mass sets the scale of a halo, all other properties are more sensitive to concentration.},

The astrophysical foregrounds are dominated by diffuse synchrotron emission from our Galaxy. Here we present a simulation of the Galactic emission used as a foreground module for the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)-EoR key science project end-to-end simulations. The simulation produces total and polarized intensity over 10\textdegree\texttimes{} 10\textdegree{} maps of the Galactic synchrotron and free\textendash free emission, including all observed characteristics of the emission: spatial fluctuations of amplitude and spectral index of the synchrotron emission, together with Faraday rotation effects. The importance of these simulations arises from the fact that the Galactic polarized emission could behave in a manner similar to the EoR signal along the frequency direction. As a consequence, an improper instrumental calibration will give rise to leakages of the polarized to the total signal and mask the desired EoR signal. In this paper, we address this for the first time through realistic simulations.},

  abstract = {Aims: This study aims to characterise the polarized foreground  emission in the ELAIS-N1 field and to address its possible implications for extracting of the cosmological 21 cm signal from the LOw-Frequency ARray - Epoch of Reionization (LOFAR-EoR) data. Methods: We used the high band antennas of LOFAR to image this region and RM-synthesis to unravel structures of polarized emission at high Galactic latitudes. Results: The brightness temperature of the detected Galactic emission is on average \textasciitilde 4 K in polarized intensity and covers the range from -10 to + 13 rad m-2 in Faraday depth. The total polarized intensity and polarization angle show a wide range of morphological features. We have also used the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at 350 MHz to image the same region. The LOFAR and WSRT images show a similar complex morphology at comparable brightness levels, but their spatial correlation is very low. The fractional polarization at 150 MHz, expressed as a percentage of the total intensity, amounts to {$\approx$}1.5\%. There is no indication of diffuse emission in total intensity in the interferometric data, in line with results at higher frequencies  Conclusions: The wide frequency range, high angular resolution, and high sensitivity make LOFAR an exquisite instrument for studying Galactic polarized emission at a resolution of \textasciitilde 1-2 rad m-2 in Faraday depth. The different polarized patterns observed at 150 MHz and 350 MHz are consistent with different source distributions along the line of sight wring in a variety of Faraday thin regions of emission. The presence of polarized foregrounds is a serious complication for epoch of reionization experiments. To avoid the leakage of polarized emission into total intensity, which can depend on frequency, we need to calibrate the instrumental polarization across the field of view to a small fraction of 1\%.},

A comparison of different simulations suggests that the dominant uncertainty in our results is systematic and is smaller than 10-30per cent at all masses, depending on the halo definition used. In particular, our `Hubble volume' simulations of {$\tau$}CDM and {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmologies allow the abundance of massive clusters to be predicted with uncertainties well below those expected in all currently planned observational surveys. We show that for a range of CDM cosmologies and for a suitable halo definition, the simulated mass function is almost independent of epoch, of cosmological parameters and of the initial power spectrum when expressed in appropriate variables. This universality is of exactly the kind predicted by the familiar Press-Schechter model, although this model predicts a mass function shape that differs from our numerical results, overestimating the abundance of `typical' haloes and underestimating that of massive systems.},

  abstract = {We describe how to define an extremely large discrete realisation of a Gaussian white noise field that has a hierarchical structure and the property that the value of any part of the field can be computed quickly. Tiny subregions of such a field can be used to set the phase information for Gaussian initial conditions for individual cosmological simulations of structure formation. This approach has several attractive features: (i) the hierarchical structure based on an octree is particular well suited for generating follow up resimulation or zoom initial conditions; (ii) the phases are defined for all relevant physical scales in advance so that resimulation initial conditions are, by construction, consistent both with their parent simulation and with each other; (iii) the field can easily be made public by releasing a code to compute it - once public, phase information can be shared or published by specifying a spatial location within the realisation. In this paper we describe the principles behind creating such realisations. We define an example called PANPHASIA and in a companion paper on arXiv (Jenkins \& Booth), make public a code to compute it. With fifty octree levels Panphasia spans a factor of more than 10\^15 in linear scale - a range that significantly exceeds the ratio of the current Hubble radius to the putative CDM free-streaming scale. We show how to modify a code used for making cosmological and resimulation initial conditions so that it can take the phase information from Panphasia and, using this code, we demonstrate that it is possible to make good quality resimulation initial conditions. We define a convention for publishing phase information from Panphasia and publish the initial phases for several of the Virgo Consortium's most recent cosmological simulations including the 303 billion particle MXXL simulation.},

  abstract = {One of the most promising ways to study the epoch of reionization (EoR) is through radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutral hydrogen. These observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping of redshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities of the gas. Such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properly understood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics. We study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of 21-cm radiation from the EoR using large-scale N-body and radiative transfer simulations. We quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrum by redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionization progresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. We go on to study the effects of redshift space distortions on LOFAR observations, taking instrument noise and foreground subtraction into account. We find that LOFAR should be able to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift space distortions at spatial scales around k \texttildelow{} 0.1 Mpc-1 after {$\greaterequivlnt$}1000 h of integration time. At larger scales, sample errors become a limiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds make the extraction of the signal problematic. Finally, we show how the astrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the 21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from LOFAR observations, and how it can be used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.},

  abstract = {A proposed method for dealing with foreground emission in upcoming 21-cm observations from the epoch of reionization is to limit observations to an uncontaminated window in Fourier space. Foreground emission can be avoided in this way, since it is limited to a wedge-shaped region in \$k\_\{\textbackslash parallel\}, k\_\{\textbackslash perp\}\$ space. However, the power spectrum is anisotropic owing to redshift-space distortions from peculiar velocities. Consequently, the 21-cm power spectrum measured in the foreground avoidance window---which samples only a limited range of angles close to the line-of-sight direction---differs from the full spherically-averaged power spectrum which requires an average over \textbackslash emph\{all\} angles. In this paper, we calculate the magnitude of this "wedge bias" for the first time. We find that the bias is strongest at high redshifts, where measurements using foreground avoidance will over-estimate the power spectrum by around 100 per cent, possibly obscuring the distinctive rise and fall signature that is anticipated for the spherically-averaged 21-cm power spectrum. In the later stages of reionization, the bias becomes negative, and smaller in magnitude (\$\textbackslash lesssim 20\$ per cent). The effect shows only a weak dependence on spatial scale and reionization topology.},

The seven models are: (1) the standard cold dark matter model (SCDM) with Omega\_0=1, Lambda\_0=0 and h=0.5; (2) a low-density flat model (FL03) with Omega\_0=0.3, Lambda\_0=0.7 and h=0.75; (3) an open model (OP03) with Omega\_0=0.3, Lambda\_0=0 and h=0.75; (4) a low-density flat model (FL02) with Omega\_0=0.2, Lambda\_0=0.8 and h=1; (5) an open model (OP02) with Omega\_0=0.2, Lambda\_0=0 and h=1; (6) a low-density flat model (FL01) with Omega\_0=0.1 and Lambda\_0=0.9 and (7) an open model (OP01) with Omega\_0=0.1 and Lambda\_0=0. We find that the density profiles and morphologies of clusters depend both on Omega\_0 and on Lambda\_0=0, these properties are a monotonic function of Omega\_0. Clusters in OP01 have the steepest density profiles, their density contours are the roundest and show the smallest centre shifts among the density contours. The other extreme case is SCDM, where clusters show the least steep density profiles and the most elongated contours. For a given Omega\_0 ({$<$}1), clusters in the flat model (i.e. with Lambda\_0=1-Omega\_0) have flatter density profiles and more substructures than in the corresponding open model. Clusters in FL03 have density profiles and centre shifts close to those in SCDM, although their density contours are rounder. Our results show that, although cluster density profiles and morphologies are useful cosmological tests, low-density flat models with Omega\_0\textasciitilde 0.3, which are currently considered as a successful alternative to SCDM, can produce a substantial fraction of clusters with substructures. This is in contrast to conclusions drawn from previous work.},

It is valid for the linearly clustering regime, and its accuracy is about 10\% in xihh(rM) for the halos with mass M{$>$}(10-2-10-3)M*, where M* is the characteristic nonlinear mass. The result is found on the basis of a careful analysis for a large set of scale-free simulations with 2563 particles. The fitting formula has a weak explicit dependence on the index n of the initial power spectrum but can be equally well applied to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological models if the effective index neff of the CDM power spectrum at the scale of the halo mass replaces the index n. The formula agrees with the analytical formula of Mo \& White for massive halos with M{$>$}M*, but the Mo \& White formula significantly underpredicts xihh(rM) for the less massive halos. The difference between the fitting and the analytical formulae amounts to a factor {$>\sptilde$}2 in xihh(rM) for M=0.01M*. One of the most interesting applications of this fitting formula would be the clustering of galaxies, since the majority of halos hosting galaxies satisfies M{$<$}},

A detailed comparison between these observational results and the predictions of current cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies is carried out. We construct 60 mock samples for each theoretical model from a large set of high-resolution N-body simulations, which allows us to include various observational selection e\textdagger ects in the analyses and to use exactly the same methods for both real and theoretical samples. We demonstrate that such a procedure is essential in the comparison between models and observations. The observed two-point correlation function is signi\DH cantly \~Natter than the mass correlation function in current CDM models on scales [1 h\textasciitilde 1 Mpc. The observed pairwise velocity dispersion is also lower than that of dark matter particles in these models. We propose a simple antibias model to explain these discrepancies. This model assumes that the number of galaxies per unit dark matter mass, N/M, decreases with the mass of dark haloes. The predictions of CDM models with p8)0 0.6D0.4\`E0.5 and !D0.2 are in agreement with the observational results, if the trend of N/M with M is at the level already observed for rich clusters of galaxies. Thus CDM models with !D0.2 and with cluster- abundance normalization are consistent with the observed correlation function and pairwise velocity dis- persion of galaxies. A high level of velocity bias is not required in these models.},

The method has several important advantages over the conventional correlation function analysis. By applying this method to a set of high-resolution simulations of 256\^3 particles, we have accurately determined the Lagrangian bias, over 4 magnitudes in halo mass, for four scale-free models with the index n=-0.5, -1.0, -1.5 and -2.0 and three typical CDM models. Our result for massive halos with \$M \textbackslash ge M\_*\$ (\$M\_*\$ is a characteristic non-linear mass) is in very good agreement with the analytical formula of Mo \& White for the Lagrangian bias, but the analytical formula significantly underestimates the Lagrangian clustering for the less massive halos \$M {$<$} M\_*. Our simulation result however can be satisfactorily described, with an accuracy better than 15\%, by the fitting formula of Jing for Eulerian bias under the assumption that the Lagrangian clustering and the Eulerian clustering are related with a linear mapping. It implies that it is the failure of the Press-Schechter theories for describing the formation of small halos that leads to the inaccuracy of the Mo \& White formula for the Eulerian bias. The non-linear mapping between the Lagrangian clustering and the Eulerian clustering, which was speculated as another possible cause for the inaccuracy of the Mo \& White formula, must at most have a second-order effect. Our result indicates that the halo formation model adopted by the Press-Schechter theories must be improved.},

The density profiles of those simulated halos are well approximated by a sequence of the concentric triaxial distribution with their axis directions being fairly aligned. We characterize the triaxial model quantitatively by generalizing the universal density profile, that has previously been discussed only in the framework of the spherical model. We obtain a series of practically useful fitting formulae in applying the triaxial model: the mass and redshift dependence of the axis ratio, the mean of the concentration parameter, and the probability distribution functions of the axis ratio and the concentration parameter. These accurate fitting formulae form a complete description of the triaxial density profiles of halos in cold dark matter models. Our current description of the dark halos will be particularly useful in predicting a variety of nonsphericity effects, to a reasonably reliable degree, including the weak and strong lens statistics, the orbital evolution of galactic satellites and triaxiality of galactic halos, and the nonlinear clustering of dark matter. In addition, this provides a useful framework for the nonspherical modeling of the intracluster gas, which is crucial in discussing the gas and temperature profiles of X-ray clusters and the Hubble constant estimated via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.},

We also analyse temporal correlations, determine diffractive scales, examine the relative fractions of time occupied by various types of ionospheric activity and detail a method to reconstruct the total electron content responsible for the ionospheric data we observe.

  abstract = {We investigate the spatial clustering of dark matter halos, collapsing from \$1-4 \textbackslash sigma\$ fluctuations, in the redshift range \$0 - 5\$ using N-body simulations. The halo bias of high redshift halos (\$z \textbackslash geq 2\$) is found to be strongly non-linear and scale-dependent on quasi-linear scales that are larger than their virial radii (\$0.5-10\$ Mpc/h). However, at lower redshifts, the scale-dependence of non-linear bias is weaker and and is of the order of a few percent on quasi-linear scales at \$z \textbackslash sim 0\$. We find that the redshift evolution of the scale dependent bias of dark matter halos can be expressed as a function of four physical parameters: the peak height of halos, the non-linear matter correlation function at the scale of interest, an effective power law index of the rms linear density fluctuations and the matter density of the universe at the given redshift. This suggests that the scale-dependence of halo bias is not a universal function of the dark matter power spectrum, which is commonly assumed. We provide a fitting function for the scale dependent halo bias as a function of these four parameters. Our fit reproduces the simulation results to an accuracy of better than 4\% over the redshift range \$0\textbackslash leq z \textbackslash leq 5\$. We also extend our model by expressing the non-linear bias as a function of the linear matter correlation function. Our results can be applied to the clustering of halos at any redshift, including those hosting early generations of stars or galaxies before reionization.},

We compare three WDM models with a dark matter (DM) mass of 0.5, 0.75, and 2.0 keV with the standard cold dark matter case. For a fixed set of parameters describing the baryonic physics, the WDM models predict fewer galaxies at low (stellar) masses, as expected due to the suppression of power on small scales, while no substantial difference is found at the high-mass end. However, these differences in the stellar mass function vanish when a different set of parameters is used to describe the (largely unknown) galaxy formation processes. We show that it is possible to break this degeneracy between DM properties and the parameterization of baryonic physics by combining observations on the stellar mass function with the Tully-Fisher relation (the relation between stellar mass and the rotation velocity at large galactic radii as probed by resolved H I rotation curves). WDM models with a too warm candidate (m {$\nu$} {$<$} 0.75 keV) cannot simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass function and the Tully-Fisher relation. We conclude that accurate measurements of the galaxy stellar mass function and the link between galaxies and DM halos down to the very low mass end can give very tight constraints on the nature of DM candidates.},

  abstract = {We outline a simple approach to understanding the physical origin of bias in the distribution of galaxies relative to that of dark matter. The first step is to specify how collapsed, virialized haloes of dark matter trace the overall matter distribution. If the quantity M* is defined to be the halo mass that has typically just collapsed by the present day, then on large scales, haloes of mass M* are unbiased tracers of the underlying matter distribution. Haloes with masses greater than M* are positively biased, while haloes less massive than M* are antibiased with respect to the dark matter. These conclusions are independent of the assumed shape of the power spectrum. The next step is to make a connection between haloes and the luminous galaxies we observe. We appeal to the results of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation that are tuned to fit the observed luminosity functions of local groups and clusters. Using these models, we are able to specify the luminosities and morphological types of the galaxies contained within a halo of given mass at the present day. We have also used a high-resolution N-body simulation of a cold dark matter (CDM) universe to study the bias relation in more detail. The differences between the galaxy and dark matter distributions are quantified using a number of different clustering statistics, including the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, the void probability function and the one-point probability density function. Both the semi- analytic and N-body techniques lead to the following general conclusions. (1) A comparison of the galaxy and dark matter density fields shows that linear biasing is a good description on large scales for galaxies of all types and luminosities. (2) The bias factor b depends on the shape and normalization of the power spectrum. The lower the normalization, the larger the bias. More bias is obtained for spectra with more power on large scales. For `realistic' models, b ranges from 1 to 2.5. (3) Galaxies of different luminosity or morphology have different bias factors. (4) The scale dependence of the bias factor is weak.},

  abstract = {We use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study how structure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and on stellar mass. Local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixed absolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 Mpc in projected radius and +/-500 km s-1 in depth. The stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by almost a factor of two towards higher masses between low- and high-density regions. At fixed stellar mass both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly on local density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration are almost independent of it. Only for low-mass galaxies (M* {$<$} 3 \texttimes{} 1010 Msolar, where M*= stellar mass) do we find a weak shift towards greater concentration and compactness in the highest-density regions. The galaxy property most sensitive to environment is specific star formation rate (SFR). For galaxies with stellar masses in the range 1010-3 \texttimes{} 1010 Msolar, the median SFR/M* decreases by more than a factor of 10 as the population shifts from predominantly star-forming at low densities to predominantly inactive at high densities. This decrease is less marked, but still significant, for high-mass galaxies. Galaxy properties that are associated with star formation correlate strongly with local density. At fixed stellar mass twice as many galaxies host active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong [OIII] emission in low-density regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments also contain more dust. To gain insight into the processes that shut down star formation, we analyse correlations between spectroscopic indicators that probe the star formation history (SFH) on different time-scales: the lambda4000 break strength, the Balmer-absorption index HdeltaA, and the specific SFR/M*. The correlations between these indicators do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease in star formation activity in dense environments occurs over long ({$>$}1-Gyr) time-scales. Since structure does not depend on environment for galaxies with masses greater than 3 \texttimes{} 1010 Msolar, the trends in recent SFH, dust and nuclear activity in these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure, for example mergers or harassment. The SFH-density correlation is strongest for small-scale estimates of local density. We see no evidence that star formation history depends on environment more than 1 Mpc from a galaxy. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity between the changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as a function of redshift.

  abstract = {The 21cm neutral hydrogen line is likely to be a key probe for studying the epoch of reionization and comic dawn in the forthcoming decades. This prospect stimulates the development of the theoretical basis for simulating the power spectrum of this line. Because of the beam size of the upcoming radio telescopes at high redshifts, most of the theoretical models are focused on the inhomogeneities on scales above few comoving megaparsecs. Therefore, smaller scales are often neglected and modeled with approximated sub-grid models. In this study we explore whether the perturbations on small scales (\$\textbackslash lesssim 1h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\$) can affect the 21cm signal on larger scales. Two distinct mechanism are discussed. First, we show that during the cosmic dawn small scale perturbations regulate the formation time of the first Lyman-alpha Emitters (LAE), and consequently the coupling timing of spin and kinetic temperatures. Due to the low number density of LAE, the inhomogeneity of coupling includes the shot noise and manifests itself in the observed 21cm power spectrum. Second mechanism works during the reionization when the ionized bubbles actively grow and overlap. Small scales perturbations affect the galactic properties and merger histories, and consequently the number of ionizing photons produced by each galaxy. The ionizing photons bring the perturbations from the galactic scales to the scales of ionizing fronts, affecting the 21cm power spectrum. We conclude that these two effects introduce stochasticity in the potentially observed 21cm power spectrum and, moreover, might give another perspective into the physics of the first galaxies.},

We find that halos formed in simulations with gas cooling are significantly more spherical than corresponding halos formed in adiabatic simulations. Gas cooling results in an average increase of the principle axis ratios of halos by \textasciitilde 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions. The systematic difference decreases slowly with radius but persists almost to the virial radius. We argue that the differences in simulations with and without cooling arise both during periods of quiescent evolution, when gas cools and condenses toward the center, and during major mergers. We perform a series of high-resolution N-body simulations to study the shapes of remnants in major mergers of DM halos and halos with embedded stellar disks. In the DM halo-only mergers, the shape of the remnants depends only on the orbital angular momentum of the encounter and not on the internal structure of the halos. However, significant shape changes in the DM distribution may result if stellar disks are included. In this case the shape of the DM halos is correlated with the morphology of the stellar remnants.},

  abstract = {Star-formation rates (SFR) of disk galaxies strongly correlate with stellar mass, with a small dispersion in SSFR at fixed mass, sigma\textasciitilde 0.3 dex. With such small scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as deterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple consequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by approximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a random walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at the previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of star-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for stochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are correlated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an expectation that should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have a relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and its evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to constrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important observables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation. The evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways to generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as mergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the classification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous formation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their star-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's insensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the ability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic baselines.

Thus, the abundance of Milky Way satellite galaxies depends on the mass of the warm particle and also scales with the mass of the host galactic halo. We use the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to compare predicted satellite luminosity functions to Milky Way data and determine a lower bound on the thermally produced WDM particle mass. This depends strongly on the Milky Way halo mass and, to some extent, on the baryonic physics assumed. For our fiducial model, we find that for a particle mass of 3.3 keV (the 2{$\sigma$} lower limit from an analysis of the Lyman {$\alpha$} forest by Viel et al.) the Milky Way halo mass is required to be {$>$}1.4 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$}. For this same fiducial model, we also find that all WDM particle masses are ruled out (at 95 per cent confidence) if the Milky Way halo mass is smaller than 1.1 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$}, while if the mass of the Galactic halo is greater than 1.8 \texttimes{} 1012 M{$\odot$}, only WDM particle masses larger than 2 keV are allowed.},

However, connecting 21cm statistics to underlying physical parameters is complicated by the theoretical challenge of modeling the relevant physics at computational speeds quick enough to enable exploration of the high dimensional and weakly constrained parameter space. In this work, we use machine learning algorithms to build a fast emulator that mimics expensive simulations of the 21cm signal across a wide parameter space to high precision. We embed our emulator within a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo framework, enabling it to explore the posterior distribution over a large number of model parameters, including those that govern the Epoch of Reionization, the Epoch of X-ray Heating, and cosmology. As a worked example, we use our emulator to present an updated parameter constraint forecast for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array experiment, showing that its characterization of a fiducial 21cm power spectrum will considerably narrow the allowed parameter space of reionization and heating parameters, and could help strengthen Planck's constraints on \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$. We provide both our generalized emulator code and its implementation specifically for 21cm parameter constraints as publicly available software.},

HERA is a drift-scan array with a 10\textdegree{} wide field of view, meaning bright, well-characterized point-source transits are scarce. This, combined with HERA's redundant sampling of the uv plane and the modest angular resolution of the Phase I instrument, make traditional sky-based and self-calibration techniques difficult to implement with high dynamic range. Nonetheless, in this work, we demonstrate calibration for HERA using point-source catalogs and electromagnetic simulations of its primary beam. We show that unmodeled diffuse flux and instrumental contaminants can corrupt the gain solutions and present a gain-smoothing approach for mitigating their impact on the 21 cm power spectrum. We also demonstrate a hybrid sky and redundant calibration scheme and compare it to pure sky-based calibration, showing only a marginal improvement to the gain solutions at intermediate delay scales. Our work suggests that the HERA Phase I system can be well calibrated for a foreground avoidance power spectrum estimator by applying direction-independent gains with a small set of degrees of freedom across the frequency and time axes.},

In a companion paper, we outlined the mathematical formalism for such systematics and presented algorithms for modeling and removing them from the data. In this work, we apply these techniques to data from HERA's first observing season as a method demonstration. The data show evidence for systematics that, without removal, would hinder a detection of the 21 cm power spectrum for the targeted Epoch of Reionization (EoR) line-of-sight modes in the range 0.2 h -1 Mpc-1 {$<$} \{k\}\textbackslash parallel  {$<$} 0.5 h -1 Mpc-1. In particular, we find evidence for nonnegligible amounts of spectral structure in the raw autocorrelations that overlaps with the EoR window and is suggestive of complex instrumental effects. Through systematic modeling on a single night of data, we find we can recover these modes in the power spectrum down to the integrated noise floor, achieving a dynamic range in the EoR window of 106 in power (mK2 units) with respect to the bright galactic foreground signal. Future work with deeper integrations will help determine whether these systematics can continue to be mitigated down to EoR levels. For future observing seasons, HERA will have upgraded analog and digital hardware to better control these systematics in the field.},

The indicators were extracted from over 500 subsamples of the Virgo Hubble volume simulation cluster catalog. The ``real'' correlation function was determined from the full survey in a 3000 h21 Mpc periodic cube. The estimators were ranked by the cumulative probability of returning a value within a certain tolerance of the real correlation function. This criterion takes into account bias and variance, and it is independent of the possibly non-Gaussian nature of the error statistics. As a result, for astrophysical applications, a clear recommendation has emerged: the Landy \& Szalay estimator, in its original or grid version (Szapudi \& Szalay), is preferred in comparison with the other indicators examined, with a performance almost indistinguishable from the Hamilton estimator.},

In a cross-correlation interferometer each pair of antennas measures one Fourier component with a spatial wavenumber proportional to the separation of the pair. Placing the individual antennas of the interferometer along a curve of constant width, a curve that has the same diameter in all directions, guarantees that the spatial resolution of the instrument will be independent of direction because the measured Fourier components will have the same maximum spatial wavenumber in all directions. The most uniform sampling within this circular region in Fourier space will be created by the particular symmetric curve of constant width that has the lowest degree of rotational symmetry or fewest number of sides, which is the Reuleaux triangle. The constant width curve with the highest symmetry, the circle is the least satisfactory although still considerably better than T's or Y's. In all cases, the sampling can be further improved by perturbing the antenna locations slightly off a perfect curve to break down symmetries in the antenna pattern which cause symmetries and hence nonuniformities in the sampling pattern in Fourier space. Appropriate patterns of perturbations can be determined numerically. As a numerical problem, optimizing the sampling in Fourier space can be thought of as a generalization of the traveling salesman problem to a continuous two-dimensional space. Self-organizing neural networks which are effective in solving the traveling salesman problem are also effective in generating optimal interferometer shapes. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Submillimeter Array, a cross-correlation imaging interferometer for astronomy, will be constructed with a design based on the Reuleaux triangle.},

We build a set of particle and halo data, which can serve as testbeds for comparison of cosmological models and gravitational theories with observations. We find that the FoF halo mass function shows a substantial deviation from the universal form with tangible redshift evolution of amplitude and shape. At higher redshifts, the amplitude of the mass function is lower, and the functional form is shifted toward larger values of \$\textbackslash ln (1/\textbackslash sigma)\$. We also find that the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature in the two-point correlation function of mock galaxies becomes broader with a peak position moving to smaller scales and the peak amplitude decreasing for increasing directional cosine \$\textbackslash mu\$ compared to the linear predictions.

Using published data, we have compiled the circular velocity (Vcirc) distribution function (VDF) of galaxy satellites in the Local Group. We find that within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400 h-1 kpc assuming the Hubble constant1 h=0.7) centered on the Milky Way and Andromeda, the average VDF is roughly approximated as n({$>$}Vcirc)\textasciitilde 55+/-11(Vcirc/10 km s-1)-1.4+/-0.4 h3 Mpc-3 for Vcirc in the range \textasciitilde 10-70 km s-1. The observed VDF is compared with results of high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that the VDF in models is very different from the observed one: n({$>$}Vcirc)\textasciitilde 1200(Vcirc/10 km s-1)-2.75 h3 Mpc-3. Cosmological models thus predict that a halo the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter satellites with circular velocity greater than 20 km s-1 and mass greater than 3\texttimes 108 Msolar within a 570 kpc radius. This number is significantly higher than the approximately dozen satellites actually observed around our Galaxy. The difference is even larger if we consider the abundance of satellites in simulated galaxy groups similar to the Local Group. The models predict \textasciitilde 300 satellites inside a 1.5 Mpc radius, while only \textasciitilde 40 satellites are observed in the Local Group. The observed and predicted VDFs cross at \textasciitilde 50 km s-1, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites with Vcirc{$>\sptilde$}50 km s-1 is in reasonably good agreement with observations. We conclude, therefore, that unless a large fraction of the Local Group satellites has been missed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observations and hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of some satellites with the high-velocity clouds observed in the Local Group and the existence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars either because of the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or because of gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing background.},

  abstract = {We present results of a convergence study in which we compare the density profiles of cold dark matter halos simulated with varying mass and force resolutions. We show that although increasing the mass and force resolution allows one to probe deeper into the inner halo regions, the halo profiles converge on scales larger than the ``effective'' spatial resolution of the simulation. This resolution is defined by both the force softening and the mass resolution. On radii larger than the ``effective'' spatial resolution, density profiles do not experience any systematical trends when the number of particles or the force resolution increases further. In the simulations presented in this paper, we are able to probe the density profile of a relaxed isolated galaxy-size halo on scales r=(0.005-1)rvir. We find that the density distribution at resolved scales can be well approximated by the profile suggested by Moore and coworkers: {$\rho\sptilde$}x-1.5(1+x1.5)-1, where x=r/rs and rs is the characteristic radius. The analytical profile proposed by Navarro and coworkers, {$\rho\sptilde$}x-1(1+x)-2, also provides a good fit, with the same relative errors of about 10\% for radii larger than 1\% of the virial radius. For this limit, both analytical profiles fit well because for high-concentration galaxy-size halos, the differences between these profiles become significant only on scales well below 0.01rvir. We also find that halos of similar mass may have density profiles with somewhat different parameters (characteristic radius, maximum rotation velocity, etc.) and shapes. We associate this scatter in properties with differences in halo merger histories and with the amount of substructure present in the analyzed halos.},

  abstract = {Predicting structural properties of dark matter haloes is one of the  fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the suite of MultiDark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. We find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter haloes and to make 1-2 per cent accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the ratio of the virial radius to the core radius in the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. For massive haloes, the average density profile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and the shape parameter {$\alpha$} in the Einasto approximation. We show that haloes progress through three stages of evolution. They start as rare density peaks and experience fast and nearly radial infall that brings mass closer to the centre, producing a highly concentrated halo. Here, the halo concentration increases with increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the {$\alpha$} parameter with a nearly constant core radius. Later haloes slide into the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region. At this stage, the concentration does not depend on halo mass. Once the rate of accretion and merging slows down, haloes move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core radius is staying constant. Accurate analytical fits are provided.},

We find that the involvement of gas physics does not have a statistically significant effect on either property - at least not for the most massive subhaloes considered in this study. However, we observe in both simulations including and excluding gas dynamics a (pronounced) evolution of the dark matter shapes of subhaloes as well as of the radial alignment signal since infall time. Further, this evolution is different when positioned in the central and outer regions of the host halo today; while subhaloes tend to become more aspherical in the central 50 per cent of their host's virial radius, the radial alignment weakens in the central regime while strengthening in the outer parts. We confirm that this is due to tidal torquing and the fact that subhaloes at pericentre move too fast for the alignment signal to respond.},

These codes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends (FOF), spherical-overdensity (SO) and phase-space based algorithms. We further introduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allows halo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against those presented here. This set includes mock haloes containing various levels and distributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as a cosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. All the halo finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location of our mock haloes. They further returned lists of particles (potentially) belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of the circular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. All the finders based in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was located close to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the mass recovered varies from finder to finder. Those finders based in phase space could resolve central substructure although they found difficulties in accurately recovering its properties. Via a resolution study we found that most of the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than 30-40 particles. However, also here the phase space finders excelled by resolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. By comparing the halo finders using a high resolution cosmological volume we found that they agree remarkably well on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass, position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).},

  abstract = {The ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations of cosmic structure formation demand equally sophisticated tools for their analysis. During the past decade, the art of object finding in these simulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. A multitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques have been spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will provide the same (physical) information about the structures of interest. Here we summarize and extent previous work of the `halo finder comparison project': we investigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders. To this extent, we decipher and discuss differences in halo-finding methods, clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties. We observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objects leading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and Vmax function, but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by all finders differ. The strength of the variation, however, depends on the property studied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass and the peak value of the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derived quantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. Our study indicates that the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codes stems from the distinct particle collection methods and - to a minor extent - the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles is implemented. We close with a discussion of the relevance and implications of the scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical galaxy formation models, gravitational lensing and observables in general.},

Two-dimensional power spectra (power in Fourier modes parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight) formed from interferometric visibilities have been shown to delineate a boundary between spectrally-smooth foregrounds (known as the wedge) and spectrally-structured 21 cm background emission (the EoR-window). However, polarized foregrounds are known to possess spectral structure due to Faraday rotation, which can leak into the EoR window. In this work, we create and analyze 2D power spectra from the PAPER-32 imaging array in Stokes I, Q, U and V. These allow us to observe and diagnose systematic effects in our calibration at high signal-to-noise within the Fourier space most relevant to EoR experiments. We observe well-defined windows in the Stokes visibilities, with Stokes Q, U and V power spectra sharing a similar wedge shape to that seen in Stokes I. With modest polarization calibration, we see no evidence that polarization calibration errors move power outside the wedge in any Stokes visibility, to the noise levels attained. Deeper integrations will be required to confirm that this behavior persists to the depth required for EoR detection.},

  abstract = {Foreground power dominates the measurements of interferometers that seek a statistical detection of highly-redshifted HI emission from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The inherent spectral smoothness of synchrotron radiation, the dominant foreground emission mechanism, and the chromaticity of the instrument allows these experiments to delineate a boundary between spectrally smooth and structured emission in Fourier space (the "wedge" or "pitchfork", and the "EoR Window", respectively). Faraday rotation can inject spectral structure into otherwise smooth polarized foreground emission, which through instrument effects or miscalibration could possibly pollute the EoR Window. Using data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) 19-element commissioning array, we investigate the polarization response of this new instrument in the power spectrum domain. We confirm the expected structure of foreground emission in Fourier space predicted by Thyagarajan et al. (2015a, 2016) for a HERA-type dish, and detect polarized power within the pitchfork. Using simulations of the polarized response of HERA feeds, we find that almost all of the power in Stokes Q, U and V can be attributed to instrumental leakage effects. Power consistent with noise in the EoR window suggests a negligible amount of spectrally-structured polarized power, to the noise-levels attained. This lends confidence to deep integrations with HERA in the future, but with a lower noise floor these future studies will also have to investigate their polarized response.},

  abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H 0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 {$\pm$} 0.012 (68\% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5\% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, {$\sum$}m {$\nu$} {$<$} 0.58 eV(95\%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34+0.86 -0.88 (68\% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H 0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = -1.10 {$\pm$} 0.14 (68\% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 {$\pm$} 0.075 (68\% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21{$\sigma$}, compared with 13{$\sigma$} from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38\% to {$\Delta$} {$\alpha$} =-1.1{$\pm$} 1.4\textdegree{} statistical {$\pm$} 1.5 systematic (68\% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

  abstract = {Concerted effort is currently ongoing to open up the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) (\$z\textbackslash sim\$15-6) for studies with IR and radio telescopes. Whereas IR detections have been made of sources (Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ emitters, quasars and drop-outs) in this redshift regime in relatively small fields of view, no direct detection of neutral hydrogen, via the redshifted 21-cm line, has yet been established. Such a direct detection is expected in the coming years, with ongoing surveys, and could open up the entire universe from \$z\textbackslash sim\$6-200 for astrophysical and cosmological studies, opening not only the EoR, but also its preceding Cosmic Dawn (\$z\textbackslash sim\$30-15) and possibly even the later phases of the Dark Ages (\$z\textbackslash sim\$200-30). All currently ongoing experiments attempt statistical detections of the 21-cm signal during the EoR, with limited signal-to-noise. Direct imaging, except maybe on the largest (degree) scales at lower redshifts, as well as higher redshifts will remain out of reach. The Square Kilometre Array(SKA) will revolutionize the field, allowing direct imaging of neutral hydrogen from scales of arc-minutes to degrees over most of the redshift range \$z\textbackslash sim\$6-28 with SKA1-LOW, and possibly even higher redshifts with the SKA2-LOW. In this SKA will be unique, and in parallel provide enormous potential of synergy with other upcoming facilities (e.g. JWST). In this chapter we summarize the physics of 21-cm emission, the different phases the universe is thought to go through, and the observables that the SKA can probe, referring where needed to detailed chapters in this volume (Abridged).},

These galaxy samples are constructed by matching the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 with the latest Galaxy Evolution Explorer source catalogue which provides NUV photometry. We present cross-correlation function measurements and determine the halo occupation distribution of green valley galaxies using a new multiple tracer analysis technique. We extend the halo occupation formalism, which describes the relation between galaxies and halo mass in terms of the probability P(N, Mh) that a halo of given mass Mh contains N galaxies, to model the cross-correlation function between a galaxy sample of interest and multiple tracer populations simultaneously. This method can be applied to commonly used luminosity threshold samples as well as to colour and luminosity bin selected galaxy samples, and improves the accuracy of clustering analyses for sparse galaxy populations. We confirm the previously observed trend that red galaxies reside in more massive haloes and are more likely to be satellite galaxies than average galaxies of similar luminosity. While the change in central galaxy host mass as a function of colour is only weakly constrained, the satellite fraction and characteristic halo masses of green satellite galaxies are found to be intermediate between those of blue and red satellite galaxies.},

  abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD), the probability for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat LCDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the subhalos, distinct gravitationally-bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the first moment of the HOD, (M), has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by a Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for {$<$}4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number Ns of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a step-like function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment (M). We find that \textasciitilde M\^b with b\textasciitilde 1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z=0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fit by a power law down to \textasciitilde 100/h kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. At redshifts z{$>\sptilde$}1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

There is further evidence that the CMB shows irregularities and for anisotropic cosmic expansion. The overall impression one obtains, given the best data we have, is matter to be arranged as not expected in the dark-matter based standard model of cosmology (SMoC). There appears to be too much structure, regularity and organisation. Dynamical friction on the dark matter halos is a strong direct test for the presence of dark matter particles, but this process does not appear to be operative in the real Universe. This evidence suggests strongly that dynamically relevant dark matter does not exist and therefore cosmology remains largely not understood theoretically. More-accepted awareness of this case would by itself constitute a major advance in research providing fabulous opportunities for bright minds, and the observational data strongly suggest that gravitation must be effectively Milgromian, corresponding to a generalized Poisson equation in the classical limit. Thus, physical cosmology offers a significant historically relevant opportunity for ground-breaking work, at least for those daring to do so.},

We consider constant equation of state models, and allow both w{$>$}=-1 and w {$<$} -1. Using five simulations with w ranging from -1.5 to -0.5, and with more than \textasciitilde 1600 well-resolved haloes each, we show that the halo concentration model of Bullock et al. accurately predicts the median concentrations of haloes over the range of w, halo masses and redshifts that we are capable of probing. We find that the Bullock et al. model works best when halo masses and concentrations are defined relative to an outer radius set by a cosmology-dependent virial overdensity. For a fixed power spectrum normalization and fixed-mass haloes, larger values of w lead to higher concentrations and higher halo central densities, both because collapse occurs earlier and because haloes have higher virial densities. While precise predictions of halo densities are quite sensitive to various uncertainties, we make broad comparisons to galaxy rotation curve data. At fixed power spectrum normalization (fixed {$\sigma$}8), w {$>$} -1 quintessence models seem to exacerbate the central density problem relative to the standard w=-1 model. For example, models with w\textasciitilde =- 0.5 seem disfavoured by the data, which can be matched only by allowing extremely low normalizations, {$\sigma$}8{$<\sptilde$} 0.6. Meanwhile w {$<$} -1 models help to reduce the apparent discrepancy. We confirm that the halo mass function of Jenkins et al. provides an excellent approximation to the abundance of haloes in our simulations and extend its region of validity to include models with w {$<$} -1.},

  abstract = {We present a study of the shapes, orientations, and alignments of Galactic dark matter subhalos in the Via Lactea simulation of a Milky Way-size {$\Lambda$}CDM host halo. Whereas isolated dark matter halos tend to be prolate, subhalos are predominantly triaxial. Overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo, with minor-to-major and intermediate-to-major axis ratios of 0.68 and 0.83, respectively. Like isolated halos, subhalos tend to be less spherical in their central regions. The principal axis ratios are independent of subhalo mass when the shapes are measured within a physical scale such as rVmax, the radius of the peak of the circular velocity curve. Subhalos tend to be slightly more spherical closer to the host halo center. The spatial distribution of the subhalos traces the prolate shape of the host halo when they are selected by the largest Vmax they ever had, i.e., before they experienced strong tidal mass loss. The subhalos' orientation is not random: the major axis tends to align with the direction toward the host halo center. This alignment disappears for halos beyond 3r200 and is more pronounced when the shapes are measured in the outer regions of the subhalos. The radial alignment is preserved during a subhalo's orbit and they become elongated during pericenter passage, indicating that the alignment is likely caused by the host halo's tidal forces. These tidal interactions with the host halo act to make subhalos rounder over time.},

In this approach, galaxies of a given type are probabilistically assigned to individual halos in N-body simulations. In this paper, we present a fast emulator for predicting the fully nonlinear galaxy-galaxy auto and galaxy-dark matter cross power spectrum and correlation function over a range of freely specifiable HOD modeling parameters. The emulator is constructed using results from 100 HOD models run on a large {$\Lambda$}CDM N-body simulation, with Gaussian Process interpolation applied to a PCA-based representation of the galaxy power spectrum. The total error is currently {$\sim$}1\% in the auto correlations and {$\sim$}2\% in the cross correlations from z = 1 to z = 0, over the considered parameter range. We use the emulator to investigate the accuracy of various analytic prescriptions for the galaxy power spectrum, parametric dependencies in the HOD model, and the behavior of galaxy bias as a function of HOD parameters. Additionally, we obtain fully nonlinear predictions for tangential shear correlations induced by galaxy-galaxy lensing from our galaxy-dark matter cross power spectrum emulator.

Experiments like the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and Murchison Widefield Array Phase II (MWA) feature highly-redundant antenna layouts, building sensitivity through redundant measurements of the same angular Fourier modes, at the expense of diminished UV coverage. This strategy limits the numbers of independent samples of each power spectrum mode, thereby increasing the effect of sample variance on the final power spectrum uncertainty. To better quantify this effect, we measure the sample variance of a delay-transform based power spectrum estimator, using both analytic calculations and simulations of flat-spectrum EoR-like signals. We find that for the shortest baselines in HERA, the sample variance can reach as high as 20\%, and up to 30\% for the wider fields-of-view of the MWA. Combining estimates from all the baselines in a HERA- or MWA-like 37 element redundant hexagonal array can lower the variance to \$1-3\$\% for some Fourier modes. These results have important implications for observing and analysis strategies, and suggest that sample variance can be non-negligible when constraining EoR model parameters from upcoming 21cm data.},

We discuss the implications of the "light cone" effect, which incorporates evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction and 21 cm brightness temperature along the line of sight. Using a novel method calibrated against radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we model the neutral hydrogen density field and 21 cm signal in large volumes (L = 2 Gpc h -1). The inclusion of the light cone effect leads to a relative decrease of about 50\% in the 21 cm power spectrum on all scales. We also find that the effect is more prominent at the midpoint of reionization and later. The light cone effect can also introduce an anisotropy along the line of sight. By decomposing the 3D power spectrum into components perpendicular to and along the line of sight, we find that in our fiducial reionization model, there is no significant anisotropy. However, parallel modes can contribute up to 40\% more power for shorter reionization scenarios. The scales on which the light cone effect is relevant are comparable to scales where one measures the baryon acoustic oscillation. We argue that due to its large comoving scale and introduction of anisotropy, the light cone effect is important when considering redshift space distortions and future application to the Alcock-Paczy\'nski test for the determination of cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {We present analysis of the three-dimensional shape of intracluster gas in clusters formed in cosmological simulations of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology and compare it to the shape of dark matter distribution and the shape of the overall isopotential surfaces. We find that in simulations with radiative cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback (CSF), intracluster gas outside the cluster core (r {$>\sptilde$} 0.1r 500) is more spherical compared to non-radiative (NR) simulations, while in the core the gas in the CSF runs is more triaxial and has a distinctly oblate shape. The latter reflects the ongoing cooling of gas, which settles into a thick oblate ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy. The shape of the gas in the inner regions of clusters can therefore be a useful diagnostic of gas cooling. We find that gas traces the shape of the underlying potential rather well outside the core, as expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. At smaller radii, however, the gas and potential shapes differ significantly. In the CSF runs, the difference reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationally supported. Interestingly, we find that in NR simulations the difference between gas and potential shape at small radii is due to random gas motions, which make the gas distribution more spherical than the equipotential surfaces. Finally, we use mock Chandra X-ray maps to show that the differences in shapes observed in a three-dimensional distribution of gas are discernible in the ellipticity of X-ray isophotes. Contrasting the ellipticities measured in simulated clusters against observations can therefore constrain the amount of cooling in the intracluster medium and the presence of random gas motions in cluster cores.},

  abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of \textasciitilde 0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) {$<$} 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution \textasciitilde 250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

While considerable effort has been invested in exploring each of these probes individually, attempts to combine them are still in their infancy. These combinations have the potential to elucidate the galaxy-dark matter connection and the galaxy formation physics responsible for it, as well as to constrain cosmological parameters and to test the nature of gravity. In this paper, we focus on a theoretical model that describes the galaxy-dark matter connection based on standard halo occupation distribution techniques. Several key modifications enable us to extract additional parameters that determine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and to simultaneously fit data from multiple probes while allowing for independent binning schemes for each probe. We construct mock catalogs from numerical simulations to investigate the effects of sample variance and covariance for each probe. Finally, we analyze how trends in each of the three observables impact the derived parameters of the model. In particular, we investigate various features of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (low-mass slope, "plateau," knee, and high-mass cutoff) and show how each feature is related to the underlying relationship between stellar and halo mass. We demonstrate that the observed "plateau" feature in the stellar mass function at M * \textasciitilde{} 2 \texttimes{} 1010 M sun is due to the transition that occurs in the stellar-to-halo mass relation at Mh \textasciitilde{} 1012 M sun from a low-mass power-law regime to a sub-exponential function at higher stellar mass.},

  abstract = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z = 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of the SHMR rises sharply at M * {$>$} 5 \texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * \textasciitilde{} 27 at M * = 4.5 \texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} and Mh = 1.2 \texttimes{} 1012 M {$\odot$}. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot halo mass," M piv h , and the "pivot ratio," (Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv h and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M piv * = 5.75 {$\pm$} 0.13 \texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} at z = 0.88 to M piv * = 3.55 {$\pm$} 0.17 \texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of M piv h leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv \textasciitilde{} 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic nucleus feedback.

They form an extension to the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project, and have been designed to help improve our understanding of cluster astrophysics and non-linear structure formation, which are now the limiting systematic errors when using clusters as cosmological probes. Starting from identical initial conditions in either the Planck or WMAP7 cosmologies, we systematically vary the most important `sub-grid' physics, including feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We compare the properties of the simulated galaxy groups and clusters to a wide range of observational data, such as X-ray luminosity and temperature, gas mass fractions, entropy and density profiles, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, I-band mass-to-light ratio, dominance of the brightest cluster galaxy and central massive black hole (BH) masses, by producing synthetic observations and mimicking observational analysis techniques. These comparisons demonstrate that some AGN feedback models can produce a realistic population of galaxy groups and clusters, broadly reproducing both the median trend and, for the first time, the scatter in physical properties over approximately two decades in mass (1013 M\&sun; {$\lessequivlnt$} M500 {$\lessequivlnt$} 1015 M\&sun;) and 1.5 decades in radius (0.05 {$\lessequivlnt$} r/r500 {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.5). However, in other models, the AGN feedback is too violent (even though they reproduce the observed BH scaling relations), implying that calibration of the models is required. The production of realistic populations of simulated groups and clusters, as well as models that bracket the observations, opens the door to the creation of synthetic surveys for assisting the astrophysical and cosmological interpretation of cluster surveys, as well as quantifying the impact of selection effects.},

  abstract = {Many cosmological models have only a finite number of parameters of interest, but a very expensive data-generating process and an intractable likelihood function. We address the problem of performing likelihood-free Bayesian inference from such black-box simulation-based models, under the constraint of a very limited simulation budget (typically a few thousand). To do so, we propose an approach based on the likelihood of an alternative parametric model. Conventional approaches to Approximate Bayesian computation such as likelihood-free rejection sampling are impractical for the considered problem, due to the lack of knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy between observed and simulated data. As a response, our strategy combines Gaussian process regression of the discrepancy to build a surrogate surface with Bayesian optimisation to actively acquire training data. We derive and make use of an acquisition function tailored for the purpose of minimising the expected uncertainty in the approximate posterior density. The resulting algorithm (Bayesian optimisation for likelihood-free inference, BOLFI) is applied to the problems of summarising Gaussian signals and inferring cosmological parameters from the Joint Lightcurve Analysis supernovae data. We show that the number of required simulations is reduced by several orders of magnitude, and that the proposed acquisition function produces more accurate posterior approximations, as compared to common strategies.},

First, when the observations span only a small number of independent spatial frequencies (\$k\$-modes) we sample directly from the spherical power spectrum coefficients that describe the EoR signal realisation. Secondly, when the number of \$k\$-modes to be included in the model becomes large, we sample from the joint probability density of the spherical power spectrum and the signal coefficients, using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to explore this high dimensional (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 20000) space efficiently. This approach has been successfully applied to simulated observations that include astrophysically realistic foregrounds in a companion publication. Here we focus on explaining the methodology in detail, and use simple foreground models to both demonstrate its efficacy, and highlight salient features. In particular, we show that including an arbitrary flat spectrum continuum foreground that is \$10\^8\$ times greater in power than the EoR signal has no detectable impact on our parameter estimates of the EoR power spectrum recovered from the data.},

In particular, in cosmologies dominated by phantom energy (with an equation of state of {$\omega$} {$<$} -1) the proper distance to the Hubble sphere decreases, and light rays can cross it more than once in both directions; such behaviour further diminishes the claim that the Hubble sphere is a fundamental, but unrecognized, horizon in the universe.},

  abstract = {Interferometric arrays seeking to measure the 21 cm signal from the  Epoch of Reionization must contend with overwhelmingly bright emission from foreground sources. Accurate recovery of the 21 cm signal will require precise calibration of the array, and several new avenues for calibration have been pursued in recent years, including methods using redundancy in the antenna configuration. The newly upgraded Phase II of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is the first interferometer that has large numbers of redundant baselines while retaining good instantaneous UV-coverage. This array therefore provides a unique opportunity to compare redundant calibration with sky-model based algorithms. In this paper, we present the first results from comparing both calibration approaches with MWA Phase II observations. For redundant calibration, we use the package OMNICAL, and produce sky-based calibration solutions with the analysis package Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD). There are three principal results. (1) We report the success of OMNICAL on observations of ORBComm satellites, showing substantial agreement between redundant visibility measurements after calibration. (2) We directly compare OMNICAL calibration solutions with those from FHD, and demonstrate these two different calibration schemes give extremely similar results. (3) We explore improved calibration by combining OMNICAL and FHD. We evaluate these combined methods using power spectrum techniques developed for EoR analysis and find evidence for marginal improvements mitigating artifacts in the power spectrum. These results are likely limited by signal-to-noise in the six hours of data used, but suggest future directions for combining these two calibration schemes.},

  abstract = {The EDGES experiment recently announced evidence for a broad absorption feature in the sky-averaged radio spectrum around 78 MHz, as may result from absorption in the 21 cm line by neutral hydrogen at z{\~ }15 - 20 . If confirmed, one implication is that the spin temperature of the 21 cm line is coupled to the gas temperature by z =20 . The known mechanism for accomplishing this is the Wouthuysen-Field effect, whereby Lyman-alpha photons scatter in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and impact the hyperfine level populations. This suggests that early star formation had already produced a copious Lyman-alpha background by z =20 , and strongly constrains models in which the linear matter power spectrum is suppressed on small-scales, since halo and star formation are delayed in such scenarios. Here we consider the case that the dark matter consists of ultra-light axions with macroscopic de Broglie wavelengths (fuzzy dark matter, FDM). We assume that star formation tracks halo formation and adopt two simple models from the current literature for the halo mass function in FDM. We further suppose that the fraction of halo baryons which form stars is less than a conservative upper limit of f\textsubscript{{$\star$}}{$\leq$}0.05 , and that{\~ }10\textsuperscript{4} Lyman-alpha to Lyman-limit photons are produced per stellar baryon. We find that the requirement that the 21 cm spin temperature is coupled to the gas temperature by z =20 places a lower-limit on the FDM particle mass of m\textsubscript{a}{$\geq$}5 \texttimes 10\textsuperscript{-21} eV . The constraint is insensitive to the precise minimum mass of halos where stars form. As the global 21 cm measurements are refined, the coupling redshift could change and we quantify how the FDM constraint would be modified. A rough translation of the FDM mass bound to a thermal relic warm dark matter (WDM) mass bound is also provided.},

  abstract = {A very simple physical model of galaxies is one in which the formation of stars is instantaneously regulated by the mass of gas in a reservoir with mass loss scaling with the star-formation rate (SFR). This model links together three different aspects of the evolving galaxy population: (1) the cosmic time evolution of the specific star-formation rate (sSFR) relative to the growth of halos, (2) the gas-phase metallicities across the galaxy population and over cosmic time, and (3) the ratio of the stellar to dark matter mass of halos. The gas regulator is defined by the gas consumption timescale ({$\varepsilon$}-1) and the mass loading {$\lambda$} of the wind outflow {$\lambda\cdot$}SFR. The simplest regulator, in which {$\varepsilon$} and {$\lambda$} are constant, sets the sSFR equal to exactly the specific accretion rate of the galaxy; more realistic situations lead to an sSFR that is perturbed from this precise relation. Because the gas consumption timescale is shorter than the timescale on which the system evolves, the metallicity Z is set primarily by the instantaneous operation of the regulator system rather than by the past history of the system. The metallicity of the gas reservoir depends on {$\varepsilon$}, {$\lambda$}, and sSFR, and the regulator system therefore naturally produces a Z(m star, SFR) relation if {$\varepsilon$} and {$\lambda$} depend on the stellar mass m star. Furthermore, this relation will be the same at all epochs unless the parameters {$\varepsilon$} and {$\lambda$} themselves change with time. A so-called fundamental metallicity relation is naturally produced by these conditions. The overall mass-metallicity relation Z(m star) directly provides the fraction f star(m star) of incoming baryons that are being transformed into stars. The observed Z(m star) relation of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies implies a strong dependence of stellar mass on halo mass that reconciles the different faint-end slopes of the stellar and halo mass functions in standard {$\Lambda$}CDM models. The observed relation also boosts the sSFR relative to the specific accretion rate and produces a different dependence on mass, both of which are observed. The derived Z(m star, SFR) relation for the regulator system is fit to published Z(m star, SFR) data for the SDSS galaxy population, yielding {$\varepsilon$} and {$\lambda$} as functions of m star. The fitted {$\varepsilon$} is consistent with observed molecular gas-depletion timescales in galaxies (allowing for the extra atomic gas), while the fitted {$\lambda$} is also reasonable. The gas-regulator model also successfully reproduces the Z(m star) metallicities of star-forming galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 2. One consequence of this analysis is that it suggests that the m star-m halo relation is established by baryonic processes operating within galaxies, and that a significant fraction (40\%) of baryons coming into the halos are being processed through the galaxies. This fraction may be more or less constant. The success of the gas-regulator model in simultaneously explaining many diverse observed relations over the 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 2 interval suggests that the evolution of galaxies is governed by simple physics that form the basis for this model.},

  abstract = {Weak-lensing peak counts has been shown to be a powerful tool for cosmology. It provides non-Gaussian information of large scale structures, complementary to second order statistics. We propose a new flexible method to predict weak lensing peak counts, which can be adapted to realistic scenarios, such as a real source distribution, intrinsic galaxy alignment, mask effects, photo-\$z\$ errors from surveys, etc. The new model is also suitable for applying the tomography technique and non-linear filters. A probabilistic approach to model peak counts is presented. First, we sample halos from a mass function. Second, we assign them NFW profiles. Third, we place those halos randomly on the field of view. The creation of these "fast simulations" requires much less computing time compared to \$N\$-body runs. Then, we perform ray-tracing through these fast simulation boxes and select peaks from weak-lensing maps to predict peak number counts. The computation is achieved by our CAMELUS algorithm, which we make available at http://www.cosmostat.org/camelus.html. We compare our results to \$N\$-body simulations to validate our model. We find that our approach is in good agreement with full \$N\$-body runs. We show that the lensing signal dominates shape noise and Poisson noise for peaks with SNR between 4 and 6. Also, counts from the same SNR range are sensitive to \$\textbackslash Omega\_\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$. We show how our model can discriminate between various combinations of those two parameters. In this paper, we offer a powerful tool to study weak lensing peaks. The potential of our forward model is its high flexibility, making the use of peak counts under realistic survey conditions feasible.},

We measure the angular auto-correlation function of Ks {$<$} 23.5 galaxies in the VIDEO-XMM3 field with photometric redshifts out to z = 4 using VIDEO and CFHTLS photometry in the near-infrared and optical. We then use the cross-correlation function of these sources with 766 radio sources at S\_1.4 {$>$} 90 \{\textbackslash mu\}Jy to infer linear bias of radio galaxies in four redshift bins. We find that the bias evolves from b = 0.57 +/- 0.06 at z \textasciitilde{} 0.3 to 8.55 +/- 3.11 at z \textasciitilde{} 2.2. Furthermore, we separate the radio sources into subsamples to determine how the bias is dependent on the radio luminosity, and find a bias which is significantly higher than predicted by the simulations of Wilman et al., and consistent with the lower luminosity but more abundant FR-I population having a similar bias to the highly luminous but rare FR-IIs. Our results are suggestive of a higher mass, particularly for FR-I sources than assumed in simulations, especially towards higher redshift.},

  abstract = {[Abridged] The spatially averaged global spectrum of the redshifted 21cm line has generated much experimental interest, for it is potentially a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization and the Dark Ages. Since the cosmological signal here has a purely spectral signature, most proposed experiments have little angular sensitivity. This is worrisome because with only spectra, the global 21cm signal can be difficult to distinguish from foregrounds such as Galactic synchrotron radiation, as both are spectrally smooth and the latter is orders of magnitude brighter. We establish a mathematical framework for global signal data analysis in a way that removes foregrounds optimally, complementing spectra with angular information. We explore various experimental design trade-offs, and find that 1) with spectral-only methods, it is impossible to mitigate errors that arise from uncertainties in foreground modeling; 2) foreground contamination can be significantly reduced for experiments with fine angular resolution; 3) most of the statistical significance in a positive detection during the Dark Ages comes from a characteristic high-redshift trough in the 21cm brightness temperature; and 4) Measurement errors decrease more rapidly with integration time for instruments with fine angular resolution. We show that if observations and algorithms are optimized based on these findings, an instrument with a 5 degree beam can achieve highly significant detections (greater than 5-sigma) of even extended (high Delta-z) reionization scenarios after integrating for 500 hrs. This is in contrast to instruments without angular resolution, which cannot detect gradual reionization. Abrupt ionization histories can be detected at the level of 10-100's of sigma. The expected errors are also low during the Dark Ages, with a 25-sigma detection of the expected cosmological signal after only 100 hrs of integration.},

  abstract = {For there to be a successful measurement of the 21 cm epoch of reionization (EoR) power spectrum, it is crucial that strong foreground contaminants be robustly suppressed. These foregrounds come from a variety of sources (such as Galactic synchrotron emission and extragalactic point sources), but almost all share the property of being spectrally smooth and, when viewed through the chromatic response of an interferometer, occupy a signature ``wedge'' region in cylindrical k{$\perp$}k{$\parallel$} Fourier space. The complement of the foreground wedge is termed the ``EoR window'' and is expected to be mostly foreground-free, allowing clean measurements of the power spectrum. This paper is a sequel to a previous paper that established a rigorous mathematical framework for describing the foreground wedge and the EoR window. Here, we use our framework to explore statistical methods by which the EoR window can be enlarged, thereby increasing the sensitivity of a power spectrum measurement. We adapt the Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock approximation (commonly used in galaxy surveys) for 21 cm cosmology and also compare the optimal quadratic estimator to simpler estimators that ignore covariances between different Fourier modes. The optimal quadratic estimator is found to suppress foregrounds by an extra factor of {$\sim$}105 in power at the peripheries of the EoR window, boosting the detection of the cosmological signal from 12{$\sigma$} to 50{$\sigma$} at the midpoint of reionization in our fiducial models. If numerical issues can be finessed, decorrelation techniques allow the EoR window to be further enlarged, enabling measurements to be made deep within the foreground wedge. These techniques do not assume that foreground is Gaussian distributed, and we additionally prove that a final round of foreground subtraction can be performed after decorrelation in a way that is guaranteed to have no cosmological signal loss.},

  abstract = {The 21 cm line provides a powerful probe of astrophysics and cosmology at high redshifts, but unlocking the potential of this probe requires the robust mitigation of foreground contaminants that are typically several orders of magnitude brighter than the cosmological signal. Recent simulations and observations have shown that the smooth spectral structure of foregrounds combines with instrument chromaticity to contaminate a ``wedge''-shaped region in cylindrical Fourier space. While previous efforts have explored the suppression of foregrounds within this wedge, as well as the avoidance of this highly contaminated region, all such efforts have neglected a rigorous examination of the error statistics associated with the wedge. Using a quadratic estimator formalism applied to the interferometric measurement equation, we provide a framework for such a rigorous analysis (incorporating a fully covariant treatment of errors). Additionally, we find that there are strong error correlations at high spatial wave numbers that have so far been neglected in sensitivity derivations. These error correlations substantially degrade the sensitivity of arrays relying on contributions from long baselines, compared to what one would estimate assuming uncorrelated errors.},

  abstract = {Intensity mapping is a promising technique for surveying the large scale structure of our Universe from \$z=0\$ to \$z \textbackslash sim 150\$, using the brightness temperature field of spectral lines to directly observe previously unexplored portions of out cosmic timeline. Examples of targeted lines include the \$21\textbackslash,\textbackslash textrm\{cm\}\$ hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, rotational lines of carbon monoxide, and fine structure lines of singly ionized carbon. Recent efforts have focused on detections of the power spectrum of spatial fluctuations, but have been hindered by systematics such as foreground contamination. This has motivated the decomposition of data into Fourier modes perpendicular and parallel to the line-of-sight, which has been shown to be a particularly powerful way to diagnose systematics. However, such a method is well-defined only in the limit of a narrow-field, flat-sky approximation. This limits the sensitivity of intensity mapping experiments, as it means that wide surveys must be separately analyzed as a patchwork of smaller fields. In this paper, we develop a framework for analyzing intensity mapping data in a spherical Fourier-Bessel basis, which incorporates curved sky effects without difficulty. We use our framework to generalize a number of techniques in intensity mapping data analysis from the flat sky to the curved sky. These include visibility-based estimators for the power spectrum, treatments of interloper lines, and the "foreground wedge" signature of spectrally smooth foregrounds.},

The array design features 8192 dual-polarization broad-band active dipoles, arranged into 512 tiles comprising 16 dipoles each. The tiles are quasi-randomly distributed over an aperture 1.5km in diameter, with a small number of outliers extending to 3km. All tile-tile baselines are correlated in custom FPGA-based hardware, yielding a Nyquist-sampled instantaneous monochromatic uv coverage and unprecedented point spread function (PSF) quality. The correlated data are calibrated in real time using novel position-dependent self-calibration algorithms. The array is located in the Murchison region of outback Western Australia.

Using data from phase 1 of GAMA, taken over three observing seasons, and correcting for various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands. At low redshift, z {$<$} 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to a magnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over a range of more than ten magnitudes by simple Schechter functions in all bands. Red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-law Schechter functions to fit a dip in their LF faintward of the characteristic magnitude M* before a steepening faint end. This upturn is at least partly due to dust-reddened disk galaxies. We measure evolution of the galaxy LF over the redshift range 0.002 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.5 using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned LFs in redshift slices. The characteristic luminosity L* is found to increase with redshift in all bands, with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. The comoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that of red galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud to red sequence. As well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxies also dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. At lower redshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the riz bands, by blue galaxies in u and g.},

  abstract = {Well-motivated elementary particle candidates for the dark matter, such as the sterile neutrino, behave as warm dark matter (WDM). For particle masses of the order of a keV, free streaming produces a cutoff in the linear fluctuation power spectrum at a scale corresponding to dwarf galaxies. We investigate the abundance and structure of WDM haloes and subhaloes on these scales using high resolution cosmological N-body simulations of galactic haloes of mass similar to the Milky Way's. On scales larger than the free-streaming cutoff, the initial conditions have the same power spectrum and phases as one of the cold dark matter (CDM) haloes previously simulated by Springel et al. as part of the Virgo consortium Aquarius project. We have simulated four haloes with WDM particle masses in the range 1.5-2.3 keV and, for one case, we have carried out further simulations at varying resolution. N-body simulations in which the power spectrum cutoff is resolved are known to undergo artificial fragmentation in filaments producing spurious clumps which, for small masses ({$<$}107 M{$\odot$} in our case) outnumber genuine haloes. We have developed a robust algorithm to identify these spurious objects and remove them from our halo catalogues. We find that the WDM subhalo mass function is suppressed by well over an order magnitude relative to the CDM case for masses {$<$}109 M{$\odot$}. Requiring that there should be at least as many subhaloes as there are observed satellites in the Milky Way leads to a conservative lower limit to the (thermal equivalent) WDM particle mass of \texttildelow{} 1.5 keV. WDM haloes and subhaloes have cuspy density distributions that are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White or Einasto profiles. Their central densities are lower for lower WDM particle masses and none of the models we have considered suffering from the `too big to fail' problem recently highlighted by Boylan-Kolchin et al.},

  abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation series to investigate the relation between the accretion history and mass profile of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes. We find that the mean inner density within the scale radius, r-2 (where the halo density profile has isothermal slope), is directly proportional to the critical density of the Universe at the time when the virial mass of the main progenitor equals the mass enclosed within r-2. Scaled to these characteristic values of mass and density, the average mass accretion history, expressed in terms of the critical density of the Universe, M({$\rho$}crit(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile, M({$<\rho>$}), at z = 0. Both follow closely the Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) profile, which suggests that the similarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halo accretion histories. Support for this interpretation is provided by outlier haloes whose accretion histories deviate from the NFW shape; their mass profiles show correlated deviations from NFW and are better approximated by Einasto profiles. Fitting both M({$<\rho>$}) and M({$\rho$}crit) with either NFW or Einasto profiles yield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming and extending earlier work that has linked the concentration of a halo with its accretion history. These correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive to initial conditions: only haloes whose accretion histories differ greatly from the NFW shape show notable deviations from NFW in their mass profiles. As a result, the NFW profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter haloes, which do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other than CDM. Our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of mass profile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strong support for the link between accretion history and halo structure we propose here.},

Our simulations include standard {$\Lambda$}-cold dark matter (CDM) models, and additional runs with truncated power spectra, consistent with a thermal warm dark matter (WDM) scenario. We find that the mass profiles of CDM and WDM halos are self-similar and well approximated by the Einasto pro-file. The c(M, z) relation of CDM halos is monotonic: concentrations decrease with increasing virial mass at fixed redshift, and decrease with increasing redshift at fixed mass. The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM halos are also scale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do not apply to WDM ha-los: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the characteristic scale imposed by the power-spectrum suppression. Further, the WDM c(M, z) relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass scale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower masses. We show that the assembly history of a halo can still be used to infer its concentration, provided that the total mass of its progenitors is consid-ered (the " collapsed mass history " ; CMH), rather than just that of its main ancestor. This exploits the scale-free nature of CMHs to derive a simple scaling that reproduces the mass-concentration-redshift relation of both CDM and WDM halos over a vast range of halo masses and redshifts. Our model therefore provides a robust account of the mass, redshift, cosmology and power spectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations.},

  abstract = {The excursion set theory based on spherical or ellipsoidal gravitational collapse provides an elegant analytic framework for calculating the mass function and the large-scale bias of dark matter haloes. This theory assumes that the perturbed density field evolves stochastically with the smoothing scale and exhibits Markovian random walks in the presence of a density barrier. Here, we derive an analytic expression for the halo bias in a new theoretical model that incorporates non-Markovian extension of the excursion set theory with a stochastic barrier. This model allows us to handle non-Markovian random walks and to calculate perturbatively these corrections to the standard Markovian predictions for the halo mass function and halo bias. Our model contains only two parameters: {$\kappa$}, which parametrizes the degree of non-Markovianity and whose exact value depends on the shape of the filter function used to smooth the density field, and a, which parametrizes the degree of stochasticity of the barrier. Appropriate choices of {$\kappa$} and a in our new model can lead to a closer match to both the halo mass function and the halo bias in the latest N-body simulations than the standard excursion set theory.},

These properties include the concentration parameter, c, the spin parameter, {$\lambda$}, and the mean axis ratio, . For the concentration-mass relation we find c \textasciitilde{} M-0.11vir in agreement with the model proposed by Bullock et al., but inconsistent with the alternative model of Eke et al. The normalization of the concentration-mass relation, however, is 15 per cent lower than suggested by Bullock et al. The results for {$\lambda$} and are in good agreement with previous studies, when extrapolated to the lower halo masses probed here, while c and {$\lambda$} are anticorrelated, in that high-spin haloes have, on average, lower concentrations. In an attempt to remove unrelaxed haloes from the sample, we compute for each halo the offset parameter, xoff, defined as the distance between the most bound particle and the centre of mass, in units of the virial radius. Removing haloes with large xoff increases the mean concentration by \textasciitilde 10 per cent, lowers the mean spin parameter by \textasciitilde 15 per cent, and removes the most prolate haloes. In addition, it largely removes the anticorrelation between c and {$\lambda$}, though not entirely. We also investigate the relation between halo properties and their large-scale environment density. For low-mass haloes we find that more concentrated haloes live in denser environments than their less concentrated counterparts of the same mass, consistent with recent correlation function analyses. Note, however, that the trend is weak compared to the scatter. For the halo spin parameters we find no environment dependence, while there is a weak indication that the most spherical haloes reside in slightly denser environments. Finally, using a simple model for disc galaxy formation we show that haloes that host low surface brightness galaxies are expected to be hosted by a biased subset of haloes. Not only do these haloes have spin parameters that are larger than average, they also have concentration parameters that are \textasciitilde 15 per cent lower than the average at a given halo mass. We discuss the implications of all these findings for the claimed disagreement between halo concentrations inferred from low surface brightness rotation curves, and those expected for a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effects of changes in the cosmological parameters between the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 1st, 3rd and 5th year results on the structure of dark matter haloes. We use a set of simulations that cover five decades in halo mass ranging from the scales of dwarf galaxies (Vc \textasciitilde{} 30 km s-1) to clusters of galaxies (Vc \textasciitilde{} 1000 km s-1). We find that the concentration mass relation is a power law in all three cosmologies. However, the slope is shallower and the zero-point is lower moving from WMAP1 to WMAP5 to WMAP3. For haloes of mass logM200/[h-1Msolar] = 10, 12 and 14 the differences in the concentration parameter between WMAP1 and WMAP3 are a factor of 1.55, 1.41 and 1.29, respectively. As we show, this brings the central densities of dark matter haloes in good agreement with the central densities of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies inferred from their rotation curves, for both the WMAP3 and WMAP5 cosmologies. We also show that none of the existing toy models for the concentration-mass relation can reproduce our simulation results over the entire range of masses probed. In particular, the model of Bullock et al. fails at the higher mass end (M {$>\sptilde$} 1013h-1Msolar), while the NFW model of Navarro, Frenk and White fails dramatically at the low-mass end (M {$<\sptilde$} 1012h-1Msolar). We present a new model, based on a simple modification of that of Bullock et al., which reproduces the concentration-mass relations in our simulations over the entire range of masses probed (1010 {$<\sptilde$} M {$<\sptilde$} 1015h-1Msolar). Haloes in the WMAP3 cosmology (at a fixed mass) are more flatted compared to the WMAP1 cosmology, with a medium to long axis ration reduced by \textasciitilde 10 per cent. Finally, we show that the distribution of halo spin parameters is the same for all three cosmologies.},

  abstract = {The free streaming of warm dark matter particles dampens the fluctuation spectrum, flattens the mass function of haloes and sets a fine-grained phase density limit for dark matter structures. The phase-space density limit is expected to imprint a constant-density core at the halo centre in contrast to what happens for cold dark matter. We explore these effects using high-resolution simulations of structure formation in different warm dark matter scenarios. We find that the size of the core we obtain in simulated haloes is in good agreement with theoretical expectations based on Liouville's theorem. However, our simulations show that in order to create a significant core (? kpc) in a dwarf galaxy (M\texttildelow{} 1010 M{$\odot$}), a thermal candidate with mass as low as 0.1 keV is required. This would fully prevent the formation of the dwarf galaxy in the first place. For candidates satisfying large-scale structure constraints (m{$\nu$} larger than {$\approx$}1-2 keV), the expected size of the core is of the order of 10 (20) pc for a dark matter halo with a mass of 1010 (108) M{$\odot$}. We conclude that 'standard' warm dark matter is not a viable solution for explaining the presence of cored density profiles in low-mass galaxies.},

  abstract = {We analyse the properties of dark matter haloes in the cold-plus-warm dark matter (CWDM) cosmologies. We study their dependence on the fraction and velocity dispersion of the warm particle, keeping the free-streaming scale fixed. To this end, we consider three models with the same free-streaming: (1) a mixture of 90 per cent of CDM and 10 per cent of WDM with the mass 1 keV; (2) a mixture of 50 per cent of CDM and 50 per cent of WDM with the mass 5 keV and (3) pure WDM with the mass 10 keV. `Warm' particles have rescaled -Dirac spectrum of primordial velocities (as non-resonantly produced sterile neutrinos would have). We compare the properties of haloes among these models and with a {$\Lambda$}CDM with the same cosmological parameters. We demonstrate that although these models have the same free-streaming length and the suppression of matter spectra are similar at scales probed by the Lyman {$\alpha$} forest (comoving wave-numbers k {$<$} 3-5 h Mpc-1), the resulting properties of haloes with masses below \texttildelow 1011 M{$\odot$} are different due to the different behaviour of matter power spectra at smaller scales. In particular, we find that while the number of galaxies remains the same as in the {$\Lambda$}CDM case, their density profiles become much less concentrated and hence in better agreement with current observational constraints. Our results imply that a single parameter (e.g. free-streaming length) description of these models is not enough to fully capture their effects on the structure formation process.},

Objects belonging to this class in fact are found to be associated with structures which are about an order of magnitude more massive than those that host radio-quiet AGNs. Also, masses for the black holes engines of radio-enhanced AGN emission turn out to be systematically higher than those which fuel 'normal' quasars. On the other hand, the level of radio-activity in radio-luminous objects does not seem to be connected with black hole/host galaxy mass, at variance with what found in the optical case. These results, together with evidences for different cosmological evolutions of different types of AGNs pose a serious challenge to all those models aiming at providing a unified picture for black hole-powered sources.},

We focus on the high-redshift universe (z {$>$} 6), where the structure formation process should better reflect the primordial (linear) differences in terms of matter power spectrum. We find that early epochs can be exceptional probes of the dark matter nature. Non-linear WDM power spectra and mass functions are up to 2 dex lower than in CDM and show spreads of factor of a few persisting in the whole first Gyr. Runaway molecular cooling in WDM haloes results severely inhibited because of the damping of power at large k modes and hence cosmic (Populations III and II-I) star formation rate (SFR) is usually suppressed with respect to CDM predictions. Luminous objects formed in a WDM background are very rare at z {$>$} 10, due to the sparser and retarded evolution of early WDM minihaloes during the dark ages and their lack can be fitted with a simple analytical formula depending only on magnitude and redshift. Future high-z observations of faint galaxies have the potential to discriminate between CDM and WDM scenarios by means of cosmic stellar mass density and specific SFR, as well. When compared to the effects of alternative cosmologies (e.g. non-Gaussian or dark energy models) or of high-order corrections at large z (e.g. primordial streaming motions or changes in the pristine initial mass function) the ones caused by WDM are definitely more dramatic.},

We have considered two models of reionization, one which has homogeneous recombination (HR) and the other incorporating inhomogeneous recombination (IR). We have estimated the observable quantities - quadrupole and monopole moments of H I power spectrum at redshift space from our simulated data. We find that the magnitude and nature of the ratio between the quadrupole and monopole moments of the power spectrum (P\^s\_2 /P\^s\_0) can be a possible probe for the epoch of reionization. We observe that this ratio becomes negative at large scales for bar\{x\}\_\{\{H riptscriptstyle \{I\}\}\}le 0.7 irrespective of the reionization model, which is a direct signature of an inside-out reionization at large scales. It is possible to qualitatively interpret the results of the simulations in terms of the fluctuations in the matter distribution and the fluctuations in the neutral fraction which have power spectra and cross-correlation P{$\Delta\Delta$}(k), Pxx(k) and P{$\Delta$}x(k), respectively. We find that at large scales the fluctuations in matter density and neutral fraction are exactly anticorrelated through all stages of reionization. This provides a simple picture where we are able to qualitatively interpret the behaviour of the redshift-space power spectra at large scales with varying bar\{x\}\_\{\{H riptscriptstyle \{I\}\}\} entirely in terms of a just two quantities, namely bar\{x\}\_\{\{H riptscriptstyle \{I\}\}\} and the ratio Pxx/P{$\Delta\Delta$}.

  abstract = {Galaxy-galaxy lensing is a powerful probe of the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos, but its theoretical interpretation requires a careful modeling of various contributions, such as the contribution from central and satellite galaxies. For this purpose, a phenomenological approach based on the halo model has been developed, allowing for fast exploration of the parameter space of models. In this paper, we investigate the ability of the halo model to extract information from the g-g weak lensing signal by comparing it to high-resolution dissipationless simulations that resolve subhalos. We find that the halo model reliably determines parameters such as the host halo mass of central galaxies, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites, and their radial distribution inside larger halos. If there is a significant scatter present in the central galaxy host halo mass distribution, then the mean and median mass of that distribution can differ significantly from one another, and the halo model mass determination lies between the two. This result suggests that when analyzing the data, galaxy subsamples with a narrow central galaxy halo mass distribution, such as those based on stellar mass, should be chosen for a simpler interpretation of the results.},

  abstract = {The relationship between galaxies and dark matter can be characterized by the halo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that are satellites. Here we present observational constraints from the SDSS on these quantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351,507 lenses. We use stellar masses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weak gravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in the halo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. We find that an L* galaxy with a stellar mass of 6x10\^\{10\} M\_\{sun\} is hosted by a halo with mass of 1.4x10\^\{12\} M\_\{sun\}/h, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversion efficiencies of 17\_\{-5\}\^\{+10\} (early types) and 16\_\{-6\}\^\{+15\} (late types) per cent at the 95 per cent CL (statistical, not including systematic uncertainty due to assumption of a universal initial mass function, or IMF). We find that for a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology below M\_\{stellar\}=10\^\{11\} M\_\{sun\}, in contrast to typically a factor of two difference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity. This suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range and should be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed. For higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function of stellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early and late types become larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster halos with masses above 10\^\{13\} M\_\{sun\} host ellipticals at the center, while even the brightest central spirals are hosted by halos of mass below 10\^\{13\} M\_\{sun\}.

  abstract = {We perform a statistical weak lensing analysis of dark matter profiles around tracers of halo mass from galaxy-size to cluster-size halos. In this analysis we use 170 640 isolated \textasciitilde L* galaxies split into ellipticals and spirals, 38 236 groups traced via isolated spectroscopic luminous red galaxies and 13 823 maxBCG clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey covering a wide range of richness. Together these three samples allow a determination of the density profiles of dark matter halos over three orders of magnitude in mass, from 10\^\{12\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot \}  to 10\^\{15\}M\_\{\textbackslash odot \} . The resulting lensing signal is consistent with a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) or Einasto profile on scales outside the central region. In the inner regions, uncertainty in modeling of the proper identification of the halo center and inclusion of baryonic effects from the central galaxy make the comparison less reliable. We find that the NFW concentration parameter c200b decreases with halo mass, from around 10 for galactic halos to 4 for cluster halos. Assuming its dependence on halo mass in the form of c\_\{200b\}=c\_0 (M/10\^\{14\}\{h\}\^\{-1\}\textasciitilde M\_\{\textbackslash odot  \})\^\{-\textbackslash beta \}  we find c0 = 4.6 {$\pm$} 0.7 (at z = 0.22) and {$\beta$} = 0.13 {$\pm$} 0.07, with very similar results for the Einasto profile. The slope ({$\beta$}) is in agreement with theoretical predictions, while the amplitude is about two standard deviations below the predictions for this mass and redshift, but we note that the published values in the literature differ at a level of 10-20\% and that for a proper comparison our analysis should be repeated in simulations. We compare our results to other recent determinations, some of which find significantly higher concentrations. We discuss the implications of our results for the baryonic effects on the shear power spectrum: since these are expected to increase the halo concentration, the fact that we see no evidence of high concentrations on scales above 20\% of the virial radius suggests that baryonic effects are limited to small scales, and are not a significant source of uncertainty for the current weak lensing measurements of the dark matter power spectrum.},

Halo occupation models are used to estimate halo masses and satellite fractions for these two types of AGN. The large sample size allows us to separate AGN according to the stellar mass of their host galaxies. We study how the halo masses of optical and radio AGN differ from those of the parent population at fixed M*. Halo masses deduced from clustering and from lensing agree satisfactorily. Radio AGN are found in more massive halos than optical AGN: in our samples their mean halo masses are 1.6 x 10\^\{13\} and 8 x 10\^\{11\} M\_\{sun\}/h, respectively. Optical AGN follow the same relation between stellar mass and halo mass as galaxies selected without regard to nuclear properties, but radio-loud AGN deviate significantly from this relation. The dark matter halos of radio-loud AGN are about twice as massive as those of control galaxies of the same stellar mass. This boost is independent of radio luminosity, and persists even when our analysis is restricted to field galaxies. The large-scale gaseous environment of the galaxy clearly plays a crucial role in producing observable radio emission. The dark matter halo masses that we derive for the AGN in our two samples are in good agreement with recent models in which feedback from radio AGN becomes dominant in halos where gas cools quasi-statically.},

  abstract = {The peak-background split argument is commonly used to relate the abundance of dark matter halos to their spatial clustering. Testing this argument requires an accurate determination of the halo mass function. We present a Maximum Likelihood method for fitting parametric functional forms to halo abundances which differs from previous work because it does not require binned counts. Our conclusions do not depend on whether we use our method or more conventional ones. In addition, halo abundances depend on how halos are defined. Our conclusions do not depend on the choice of link length associated with the friends-of-friends halo-finder, nor do they change if we identify halos using a spherical overdensity algorithm instead. The large scale halo bias measured from the matter-halo cross spectrum b\_x and the halo autocorrelation function b\_xi (on scales k\textasciitilde 0.03h/Mpc and r \textasciitilde 50 Mpc/h) can differ by as much as 5\% for halos that are significantly more massive than the characteristic mass M*. At these large masses, the peak background split estimate of the linear bias factor b1 is 3-5\% smaller than b\_xi, which is 5\% smaller than b\_x. We discuss the origin of these discrepancies: deterministic nonlinear local bias, with parameters determined by the peak-background split argument, is unable to account for the discrepancies we see. A simple linear but nonlocal bias model, motivated by peaks theory, may also be difficult to reconcile with our measurements. More work on such nonlocal bias models may be needed to understand the nature of halo bias at this level of precision.},

Our data set consists of 238 cluster detections from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and incorporates follow-up observations of 94 of those clusters using the Chandra X-ray Observatory or ROSAT. Here we describe and implement a new statistical framework required to self-consistently produce simultaneous constraints on cosmology and scaling relations from such data, and present results on models of dark energy. In spatially flat models with a constant dark energy equation of state, w, the cluster data yield {$\Omega$}m = 0.23 +/- 0.04,{$\sigma$}8 = 0.82 +/- 0.05 and w = -1.01 +/- 0.20, incorporating standard priors on the Hubble parameter and mean baryon density of the Universe, and marginalizing over conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties. These constraints agree well and are competitive with independent data in the form of cosmic microwave background anisotropies, type Ia supernovae, cluster gas mass fractions, baryon acoustic oscillations, galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic shear. The combination of our data with current microwave background, supernova, gas mass fraction and baryon acoustic oscillation data yields {$\Omega$}m = 0.27 +/- 0.02,{$\sigma$}8 = 0.79 +/- 0.03 and w = -0.96 +/- 0.06 for flat, constant w models. The combined data also allow us to investigate evolving w models. Marginalizing over transition redshifts in the range 0.05-1, we constrain the equation of state at late and early times to be respectively w0 = -0.88 +/- 0.21 and wet = -1.05+0.20-0.36, again including conservative systematic allowances. The combined data provide constraints equivalent to a Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit of 15.5. Our results highlight the power of X-ray studies, which enable the straightforward production of large, complete and pure cluster samples and admit tight scaling relations, to constrain cosmology. However, the new statistical framework we apply to this task is equally applicable to cluster studies at other wavelengths.},

  abstract = {The peculiar velocity of the intergalactic gas responsible for the  cosmic 21-cm background from the epoch of reionization and beyond introduces an anisotropy in the three-dimensional power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations. Measurement of this anisotropy by future 21-cm surveys is a promising tool for separating cosmology from 21-cm astrophysics. However, previous attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity or only approximated it crudely. This paper re-examines the effects of peculiar velocity on the 21-cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment and addressing several issues for the first time. (1) We show that even the angle-averaged power spectrum, P(k), is affected significantly by the peculiar velocity. (2) We re-derive the brightness temperature dependence on atomic hydrogen density, spin temperature, peculiar velocity and its gradient and redshift to clarify the roles of thermal versus velocity broadening and finite optical depth. (3) We show that properly accounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of the 21-cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the intergalactic medium found by previous work that employed the usual optically thin approximation. (4) We find that the approximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightness temperature problem by capping the velocity gradient can misestimate the power spectrum on all scales. (5) We further show that the observed power spectrum in redshift space remains finite even in the optically thin approximation if one properly accounts for the redshift-space distortion. However, results that take full account of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accurate in the limit of high spin temperature. (6) We also show that the linear theory for redshift-space distortion widely employed to predict the 21-cm power spectrum results in a \texttildelow 30 per cent error in the observationally relevant wavenumber range k\texttildelow{} 0.1-1 h Mpc-1, when strong ionization fluctuations exist (e.g. at the 50 per cent ionized epoch). We derive an alternative, quasi-linear formulation which improves upon the accuracy of the linear theory. (7) We describe and test two numerical schemes to calculate the 21-cm signal from reionization simulations to incorporate peculiar velocity effects in the optically thin approximation accurately, by real- to redshift-space re-mapping of the H I density. One is particle based, the other grid based, and while the former is most accurate, we demonstrate that the latter is computationally more efficient and can be optimized so as to achieve sufficient accuracy.},

We also assess a flux-limited sample to test the robustness of the methods applied to the full sample. These measurements are in excellent agreement with one another; the derived Schechter function parameters are phi* = 4.8 (+/- 0.3) * 10\^-3, log (M*/M\_Sun) + 2 log(h\_70) = 9.96 (+/- 0.2), and alpha = -1.33 (+/- 0.02).

The larger values of Omega\_HI and of M* imply an upward adjustment for estimates of the detection rate of future large-scale HI line surveys with, e.g., the Square Kilometer Array. A comparison with simulated galaxies from the Millennium Run and a treatment of photoheating as a method of baryon removal from HI-selected halos indicates that the disagreement between dark matter mass functions and baryonic mass functions may soon be resolved.},

This leads to two new questions: "what is valid statistical inference?" and "do existing methods achieve this?" Towards answering these questions, this paper makes three contributions. First, we express statistical inference as a process of converting observations into degrees of belief, and we give a clear mathematical definition of what it means for statistical inference to be valid. Second, we evaluate existing approaches Bayesian and frequentist approaches relative to this definition and conclude that, in general, these fail to provide valid statistical inference. This motivates a new way of thinking, and our third contribution is a demonstration that the inferential model framework meets the proposed criteria for valid and prior-free statistical inference, thereby solving perhaps the most important unsolved problem in statistics.},

We use the results of our simulations within a simple analytical model to gauge the effects of baryon physics on the halo mass function. Neglect of AGN feedback leads to a significant boost in the cluster mass function similar to that reported by other authors. However, including AGN feedback not only gives rise to systems that are similar to observed galaxy clusters, but they also reverse the global baryonic effects on the clusters. The resulting mass function is closer to the unmodified dark matter halo mass function but still contains a mass dependent bias at the 5-10 per cent level. These effects bias measurements of the cosmological parameters, such as {$\sigma$}8 and {$\Omega$}m. For current cluster surveys baryonic effects are within the noise for current survey volumes, but forthcoming and planned large SZ, X-ray and multiwavelength surveys will be biased at the per cent level by these processes. The predictions for the halo mass function including baryonic effects need to be carefully studied with larger and improved simulations. However, simulations of full cosmological boxes with the resolution we achieve and including AGN feedback are still computationally challenging.},

Our neutrino halo model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of matter clustering with a \$\textbackslash sim 20\textbackslash\%\$ accuracy up to very non-linear scales of \$k=10\textasciitilde h/\$Mpc (which would be affected by baryon physics). The largest discrepancies arise in the range \$k=0.5-1\textasciitilde h/\$Mpc where the 1-halo and 2-halo terms are comparable and are present also in a massless neutrino cosmology. However, at scales \$k{$<$}0.2\textasciitilde h/\$Mpc our neutrino halo model agrees with the results of N-body simulations at the level of 8\textbackslash\% for total neutrino masses of \${$<$}0.3\$ eV. We also model the neutrino non-linear density field as a sum of a linear and clustered component and predict the neutrino power spectrum and the cold dark matter-neutrino cross-power spectrum up to \$k=1\textasciitilde h/\$Mpc with \$\textbackslash sim\$ 30\textbackslash\% accuracy. For masses below 0.15 eV the neutrino halo model captures the neutrino induced suppression, casted in terms of matter power ratios between massive and massless scenarios, with a 2\textbackslash\% agreement with the results of N-body/neutrino simulations.

We find that simple analytic luminosity evolution is still sufficient to fit the wealth of available data on local luminosity functions, multi-frequency source counts, and redshift distributions. However, the fit requires a luminosity-dependent decline of source luminosities at high redshifts, at least for steep-spectrum sources, thus confirming earlier indications of a "downsizing" also for radio sources. The upturn of source counts at sub-mJy levels is accounted for by a straightforward extrapolation, using the empirical far-IR/radio correlation, of evolutionary models matching the far-IR counts and redshift distributions of star-forming galaxies. We also discuss the implications of the new model for the interpretation of data on large-scale clustering of radio sources and on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and for the investigation of the contribution of discrete sources to the extragalactic background. As for the ISW effect, a new analysis exploiting a very clean CMB map, yields at a substantially higher significance than reported before.},

These include algorithms for forming arbitrarily pointed tied-array beams from the regularly spaced Fourier-transform formed beams, sculpting the beams to suppress sidelobes while only losing percent-level sensitivity, and optimally estimating the position of a detected source from its observed brightness in the set of beams. We also discuss the effect that correlations in the visibility-space noise, due to cross-talk and sky contributions, have on the optimality of Fourier transform beamforming, showing that it does not strictly preserve the sky information of the \$n\^2\$ correlation, even for an idealized array.

  abstract = {(Abridged) The amplitude of the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect (tSZ) power spectrum is extremely sensitive to the abundance of galaxy clusters and therefore to fundamental cosmological parameters that control their growth, such as sigma\_8 and Omega\_m. Here we explore the sensitivity of the tSZ power spectrum to important non-gravitational ('sub-grid') physics by employing the cosmo-OWLS suite of large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, run in both the Planck and WMAP7 best-fit cosmologies. On intermediate and small angular scales (ell {$>$} \textasciitilde 1000, or theta {$<$} \textasciitilde 10 arcmin), accessible with the South Pole Telescope and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the predicted tSZ power spectrum is highly model dependent, with AGN feedback having a particularly large effect. However, at large scales, observable with the Planck telescope, the effects of sub-grid physics are minor. Comparing the simulations with observations, we find a significant amplitude offset on all measured angular scales (including large scales), if the Planck best-fit cosmology is assumed by the simulations. This is shown to be a generic result for all current tSZ models. By contrast, if the WMAP7 cosmology is adopted, there is full consistency with the Planck power spectrum measurements on large scales and agreement at the 2 sigma level with the SPT/ACT measurements at intermediate scales for our fiducial AGN model, which Le Brun et al. (2014) have shown reproduces the 'resolved' properties of the local cluster population remarkably well. These findings strongly suggest that there are significantly fewer massive galaxy clusters than expected for the Planck best-fit cosmology, which is consistent with recent measurements of the tSZ number counts. Our findings therefore pose a significant challenge to the cosmological parameter values preferred (and/or the model adopted) by the Planck primary CMB analyses.},

We present a halo mass function emulator and demonstrate improved accuracy relative to state-of-the-art analytic models. In this work, mass is defined using an overdensity criteria of 200 relative to the mean background density. Our emulator is constructed from the AEMULUS simulations, a suite of 40 N-body simulations with snapshots from z=3 to z=0. These simulations cover the flat wCDM parameter space allowed by recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae results, varying the parameters w, Omega\_m, Omega\_b, sigma\_8, N\_\{eff\}, n\_s, and H\_0. We validate our emulator using five realizations of seven different cosmologies, for a total of 35 test simulations. These test simulations were not used in constructing the emulator, and were run with fully independent initial conditions. We use our test simulations to characterize the modeling uncertainty of the emulator, and introduce a novel way of marginalizing over the associated systematic uncertainty. We confirm non-universality in our halo mass function emulator as a function of both cosmological parameters and redshift. Our emulator achieves better than 1\% precision over much of the relevant parameter space, and we demonstrate that the systematic uncertainty in our emulator will remain a negligible source of error for cluster abundance studies through at least the LSST Year 1 data set.},

We interpret these results in the framework of a phenomenological halo model and numerical simulations. Our measurements span a uniquely large range in stellar mass and redshift and reach below the characteristic stellar mass to z \texttildelow{} 2. Our results are: (1) at fixed redshift and scale, clustering amplitude depends monotonically on sample stellar mass threshold; (2) at fixed angular scale, the projected clustering amplitude decreases with redshift but the comoving correlation length remains constant; (3) characteristic halo masses and galaxy bias increase with increasing median stellar mass of the sample; (4) the slope of these relationships is modified in lower mass haloes; (5) concerning the passive galaxy population, characteristic halo masses are consistent with a simply less-abundant version of the full galaxy sample, but at lower redshifts the fraction of satellite galaxies in the passive population is very different from the full galaxy sample; (6) finally, we find that the ratio between the characteristic halo mass and median stellar mass at each redshift bin reaches a peak at log (Mh/M{$\odot$}) \texttildelow{} 12.2 and the position of this peak remains constant out to z \texttildelow{} 2. The behaviour of the full and passively evolving galaxy samples can be understood qualitatively by considering the slow evolution of the characteristic stellar mass in the redshift range probed by our survey.},

Observational constraints on halo concentration therefore map into constraints on cosmological parameters. In order to explain the observed concentrations of dark matter-dominated low surface brightness galaxies, we require a cosmology with rather little power on galaxy scales. Formally, we require {$\sigma$}8{$\Gamma$}0.6{$<$}0.23, where {$\Gamma$}0.6 is a modified shape parameter appropriate to this problem. Practically, this means that either {$\Omega$}m{$<$}0.2 or {$\sigma$}8{$<$}0.8. These limits apply as long as we insist that the cuspy halos found in simulations must describe the halos of low surface brightness galaxies. A low-density cosmology helps with the low observed concentrations, but it offers no explanation of the many cases where the shape of the density profile deviates from the predicted cuspy form. These cases must have suffered very extensive mass redistribution if the current halo formation picture is not to fail outright. It is far from clear whether any of the mass redistribution mechanisms that have been suggested (e.g., feedback) are viable.},

Not only will such measurements provide a detailed view of that epoch, but, since the 21 cm emission also traces the distribution of matter in the universe, this signal can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. The sensitivity of an interferometer to the cosmological information in the signal may depend on how precisely the angular dependence of the 21 cm three-dimensional power spectrum can be measured. Using an analytic model for reionization, we quantify all the effects that break the spherical symmetry of the three-dimensional 21 cm power spectrum. We find that upcoming observatories will be sensitive to the 21 cm signal over a wide range of scales, from larger than 100 to as small as 1 comoving Mpc. Next, we consider three methods to measure cosmological parameters from the signal: (1) direct fitting of the density power spectrum to the signal, (2) using only the velocity field fluctuations in the signal, and (3) looking at the signal at large enough scales that all fluctuations trace the density field. With the foremost method, the first generation of 21 cm observations should moderately improve existing constraints on cosmological parameters for certain low-redshift reionization scenarios, and a 2 yr observation with the second-generation interferometer MWA5000 in combination with the CMB telescope Planck could improve constraints on {$\Omega$}w, {$\Omega$}mh2, {$\Omega$}bh2, {$\Omega\nu$}, ns, and {$\alpha$}s. If the universe is substantially ionized by z\textasciitilde 12 or if spin temperature fluctuations are important, we show that it will be difficult to place competitive constraints on cosmological parameters with any of the considered methods.},

  abstract = {We develop and test an algorithm to rescale a simulated dark-matter particle distribution or halo catalogue from a standard gravity model to that of a modified gravity model. This method is based on that of Angulo \& White but with some additional ingredients to account for (i) scale-dependent growth of linear density perturbations and (ii) screening mechanisms that are generic features of viable modified gravity models. We attempt to keep the method as general as possible, so that it may plausibly be applied to a wide range of modified theories, although tests against simulations are restricted to a subclass of \$f(R)\$ models at this stage. We show that rescaling allows the power spectrum of matter to be reproduced at the \$\textbackslash sim 3\textbackslash\%\$ level in both real and redshift space up to \$k=0.1\textbackslash,h\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$; this limit can be extended to \$k=1\textbackslash,h\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ if halo internal structure is altered. We simultaneously develop an algorithm that can be applied directly to a halo catalogue, in which case the halo mass function and clustering can be reproduced at the \$\textbackslash sim 5\textbackslash\%\$ level. Finally we investigate the clustering of halo particle distributions, generated from rescaled halo catalogues, and find that a similar accuracy can be reached.},

  month = jun,
  abstract = {I examine differences in non-linear structure formation between cosmological models that share a \$z=0\$ linear power spectrum in both shape and amplitude, but that differ via their growth history. \$N\$-body simulations of these models display an approximately identical large-scale-structure skeleton, but reveal deeply non-linear differences in the demographics and properties of haloes. I investigate to what extent the spherical-collapse model can help in understanding these differences, in both real and redshift space. I discuss how this is difficult to do if one attempts to identify haloes directly, because in that case one is subject to the vagaries of halo finding algorithms. However, I demonstrate that the halo model of structure formation provides an accurate non-linear response in the power spectrum, but only if results from spherical collapse that include formation hysteresis are properly incorporated. I comment on how this fact can be used to provide per cent level accurate matter power spectrum predictions for dark energy models for \$k\textbackslash leq5\textbackslash,h\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ by using the halo model as a correction to accurate \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM simulations. In the appendix I provide some fitting functions for the linear-collapse threshold (\$\textbackslash delta\_\textbackslash mathrm\{c\}\$) and virialized overdensity (\$\textbackslash Delta\_\textbackslash mathrm\{v\}\$) that are valid for a wide range of dark energy models.

  abstract = {The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) is a serendipitous search for galaxy clusters using all publicly available data in the XMM-Newton Science Archive. Its main aims are to measure cosmological parameters and trace the evolution of X-ray scaling relations. In this paper we present the first data release from the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS-DR1). This consists of 503 optically confirmed, serendipitously detected, X-ray clusters. Of these clusters, 256 are new to the literature and 357 are new X-ray discoveries. We present 463 clusters with a redshift estimate (0.06 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.46), including 261 clusters with spectroscopic redshifts. The remainder have photometric redshifts. In addition, we have measured X-ray temperatures (TX) for 401 clusters (0.4 {$<$} TX {$<$} 14.7 keV). We highlight seven interesting subsamples of XCS-DR1 clusters: (i) 10 clusters at high redshift (z {$>$} 1.0, including a new spectroscopically confirmed cluster at z= 1.01); (ii) 66 clusters with high TX ({$>$}5 keV) (iii) 130 clusters/groups with low TX ({$<$}2 keV) (iv) 27 clusters with measured TX values in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) `Stripe 82' co-add region; (v) 77 clusters with measured TX values in the Dark Energy Survey region; (vi) 40 clusters detected with sufficient counts to permit mass measurements (under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium); (vii) 104 clusters that can be used for applications such as the derivation of cosmological parameters and the measurement of cluster scaling relations. The X-ray analysis methodology used to construct and analyse the XCS-DR1 cluster sample has been presented in a companion paper, Lloyd-Davies et al.},

  abstract = {We present detailed predictions for the redshifted 21-cm signal from the  epoch of reionization. These predictions are obtained from radiative transfer calculations on the results of large-scale (100 h-1 Mpc), high dynamic range, cosmological simulations. We consider several scenarios for the reionization history, of both early and extended reionizations. From the simulations, we construct and analyse a range of observational characteristics, from the global signal, via detailed images and spectra, to statistical representations of rms fluctuations, angular power spectra, and probability distribution functions to characterize the non-Gaussianity of the 21-cm signal. We find that the different reionization scenarios produce quite similar observational signatures, mostly differing in the redshifts of 50 per cent reionization, and of final overlap. All scenarios show a gradual transition in the global signatures of mean signal and rms fluctuations, which would make these more difficult to observe. Individual features, such as deep gaps and bright peaks, are substantially different from the mean, and mapping these with several arcminutes and 100 s of kHz resolution would provide a direct measurement of the underlying density field and the geometry of the cosmological HII regions, although significantly modified by peculiar velocity distortions. The presence of late emission peaks suggests these to be a useful target for observations. The power spectra during reionization are strongly boosted compared to the underlying density fluctuations. The strongest statistical signal is found around the time of 50 per cent reionization and displays a clear maximum at an angular scale of l \textasciitilde{} 3000-5000. We find the distribution function of emission features to be strongly non-Gaussian, with an order of magnitude higher probability of bright emission features. These results suggest that, observationally, it may be easier to find individual bright features than deriving the power spectra, which, in turn, is easier than observing individual images.},

  abstract = {We investigate for the first time the effects of a warm dark matter (WDM) power spectrum on the statistical properties of galaxies using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The WDM spectrum we adopt as a reference case is suppressed - compared to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) case - below a cut-off scale {$\approx$}1 Mpc corresponding (for thermal relic WDM particles) to a mass mX= 0.75 keV. This ensures consistency with present bounds provided by the microwave background Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data and by the comparison of hydrodynamical N-body simulations with observed Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest. We run our fiducial semi-analytic model with such a WDM spectrum to derive galaxy luminosity functions (in B, UV and K bands) and the stellar mass distributions over a wide range of cosmic epochs, to compare with recent observations and with the results in the CDM case. The predicted colour distribution of galaxies in the WDM model is also checked against the data. When compared with the standard CDM case, the luminosity and stellar mass distributions we obtain assuming a WDM spectrum are characterized by (i) flattening of the faint-end slope and (ii) sharpening of the cut-off at the bright end for z{$\lessequivlnt$} 0.8. We discuss how the former result is directly related to the smaller number of low-mass haloes collapsing in the WDM scenario, while the latter is related to the smaller number of satellite galaxies accumulating in massive haloes at a low redshift, thus suppressing the accretion of small lumps on the central, massive galaxies. These results shows how adopting a WDM power spectrum may contribute to solving two major problems of CDM galaxy formation scenarios, namely, the excess of predicted faint (low-mass) galaxies at low and - most of all - high redshifts, and the excess of bright (massive) galaxies at low redshifts.},

The magnitude limit M\_UV=-13 reached by such observations allows us to probe the WDM mass functions down to scales close to or smaller than the half-mass mode mass scale \textasciitilde 10\^9 M\_sun. This allowed for an efficient discrimination among predictions for different m\_X which turn out to be independent of the star formation efficiency adopted to associate the observed UV luminosities of galaxies to the corresponding dark matter masses. Adopting a conservative approach to take into account the existing theoretical uncertainties in the galaxy halo mass function, we derive a robust limit m\_X{$>$}1.8 keV for the mass of thermal relic WDM particles when comparing with the measured abundance of the faintest galaxies, while m\_X{$>$}1.5 keV is obtained when we compare with the Schechter fit to the observed luminosity function. The corresponding lower limit for sterile neutrinos depends on the modeling of the production mechanism; for instance m\_sterile {$>$} 4 keV holds for the Shi-Fuller mechanism. We discuss the impact of observational uncertainties on the above bound on m\_X. As a baseline for comparison with forthcoming observations from the HST Frontier Field, we provide predictions for the abundance of faint galaxies with M\_UV=-13 for different values of m\_X and of the star formation efficiency, valid up to z\textasciitilde 4.}

In three cases typical dark matter particles in the cluster core undergo between 1 and 100 collisions per Hubble time; two more explore the long (`collisionless') and short (`fluid') mean free path limits. We study the size and shape distributions of arcs and compute the cross-section for producing `extreme' arcs of various sizes. Even a few collisions per particle modifies the core structure enough to destroy the ability of the cluster to produce long, thin arcs. For larger collision frequencies the cluster must be scaled up to unrealistically large masses before it regains the ability to produce giant arcs. None of our models with self-interacting dark matter (except the `fluid' limit) is able to produce radial arcs; even the case with the smallest scattering cross-section must be scaled to the upper limit of observed cluster masses before it produces radial arcs. Apparently the elastic collision cross-section of dark matter in clusters must be very small, below 0.1cm2g-1, to be compatible with the observed ability of clusters to produce both radial arcs and giant arcs.},

We consider halos generated from {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations of gravitational clustering, as well as isolated spherical collapses. The logarithmic density slopes {$\gamma\equiv$}dlog{$\rho$}/dlogr of the {$\Lambda$}CDM halos are found to vary as power laws in radius, reaching values of {$\gamma\sptilde$}-1 at the innermost resolved radii, \textasciitilde 10-2rvir. This behavior is significantly different from that of broken-power-law models like the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile but similar to that of models like de Vaucouleurs's. Accordingly, we compare the N-body density profiles with various parametric models to find which provide the best fit. We consider an NFW-like model with arbitrary inner slope; Dehnen \& McLaughlin's anisotropic model; Einasto's model (identical in functional form to S\'ersic's model but fitted to the space density); and the density model of Prugniel \& Simien that was designed to match the deprojected form of S\'ersic's R1/n law. Overall, the best-fitting model to the {$\Lambda$}CDM halos is Einasto's, although the Prugniel-Simien and Dehnen-McLaughlin models also perform well. With regard to the spherical-collapse halos, both the Prugniel-Simien and Einasto models describe the density profiles well, with an rms scatter some 4 times smaller than that obtained with either the NFW-like model or the three-parameter Dehnen-McLaughlin model. Finally, we confirm recent claims of a systematic variation in profile shape with halo mass.},

The wealth of information encoded in this signal is, however, buried under foregrounds that are many orders of magnitude brighter. These must be removed accurately and precisely in order to reveal the feeble 21-cm signal. This requires not only the modeling of the Galactic and extra-galactic emission, but also of the often stochastic residuals due to imperfect calibration of the data caused by ionospheric and instrumental distortions. To stochastically model these effects, we introduce a new method based on `Gaussian Process Regression' (GPR) which is able to statistically separate the 21-cm signal from most of the foregrounds and other contaminants. Using simulated LOFAR-EoR data that include strong instrumental mode-mixing, we show that this method is capable of recovering the 21-cm signal power spectrum across the entire range \$k = 0.07 - 0.3 \textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm\{h\textbackslash, cMpc\^\{-1\}\}\$. The GPR method is most optimal, having minimal and controllable impact on the 21-cm signal, when the foregrounds are correlated on frequency scales \$\textbackslash gtrsim 3\$\textbackslash,MHz and the rms of the signal has \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{21cm\}\} \textbackslash gtrsim 0.1\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{noise\}\}\$.

Our Universe transitioned from darkness to light, from cold to hot, from simple and boring to the wondrous cosmic zoo we see around us today. Despite its importance, observations of reionization have been few, and their interpretation has been highly controversial. Fortunately, this is rapidly changing. We will soon enter the "Big Data'' era of this mysterious epoch, driven by an upcoming wave of observations with state-of-the-art telescopes as well as new sophisticated analysis tools. The aim of this volume is to summarize the current status and future outlook of the reionization field. We bring together leading experts in many sub-disciplines, highlighting the measurements that will illuminate our understanding of reionization and the cosmic dawn: (i) 21cm interferometry; (ii) high-redshift quasar spectra; (iii) high-redshift galaxy surveys; (iv) primary and secondary anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background; (v) high-resolution studies of the metal content of early galaxies.

  abstract = {We use a homogeneous sample of about 300, 0.3 {$<\sptilde$} z {$<\sptilde$} 3, radio-loud quasars drawn from the FIRST and 2dF QSO surveys to investigate a possible dependence of radio activity on black-hole mass. By analyzing composite spectra for the populations of radio-quiet and radio-loud QSOs -- chosen to have the same redshift and luminosity distribution -- we find with high statistical significance that radio-loud quasars are on average associated with black holes of masses \textasciitilde 10\^\{8.6\} M\_sun, about twice as large as those measured for radio-quiet quasars (\textasciitilde 10\^\{8.3\} M\_sun). We also find a clear dependence of black hole mass on optical luminosity of the form log (M\_BH/M\_sun)\_\{RL\}= 8.57(\textbackslash pm 0.06) - 0.27(\textbackslash pm 0.06) (M\_B + 24.5) and log (M\_BH/M\_sun)\_\{RQ\}= 8.43(\textbackslash pm 0.05) -0.32(\textbackslash pm 0.06) (M\_B + 24.5), respectively for the case of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars. It is intriguing to note that these two trends run roughly parallel to each other, implying that radio-loud quasars are associated to black holes more massive than those producing the radio-quiet case at all sampled luminosities. On the other hand, in the case of radio-loud quasars, we find evidence for only a weak (if any) dependence of the black hole mass on radio power. The above findings seem to support the belief that there exists -- at a given optical luminosity -- a threshold black hole mass associated with the onset of significant radio activity such as that of radio-loud QSOs; however, once the activity is triggered, there appears to be very little connection between black hole mass and level of radio output.},

  abstract = {The science achievable with SKA HI surveys will be greatly increased through the combination of HI data with that at other wavelengths. These multiwavelength datasets will enable studies to move beyond an understanding of HI gas in isolation to instead understand HI as an integral part of the highly complex baryonic processes that drive galaxy evolution. As they evolve, galaxies experience a host of environmental and feedback influences, many of which can radically impact their gas content. Important processes include: accretion (hot and cold mode, mergers), depletion (star formation, galactic winds, AGN), phase changes (ionised/atomic/molecular), and environmental effects (ram pressure stripping, tidal effects, strangulation). Governing all of these to various extents is the underlying dark matter distribution. In turn, the result of these processes can significantly alter the baryonic states in which material is finally observed (stellar populations, dust, chemistry) and its morphology (galaxy type, bulge/disk ratio, bars, warps, radial profile). To fully understand the evolution of HI and the role it plays in galactic evolution requires the ability to quantify each of these separate processes, and hence to coordinate SKA HI surveys with extensive multi-band photometric and spectroscopic campaigns. In addition, multiwavelength data is essential for statistical methods of HI analysis such as HI stacking and intensity mapping cross-correlations. In this chapter, we examine some of the principal science motivations for acquiring multiwavelength data to match that from the extragalactic SKA HI surveys, and review the currently planned capacity to achieve this (eg. LSST, Euclid, W-FIRST, SPICA, ALMA, and 4MOST).},

  abstract = {We investigate the effects of Population III stars on the sky-averaged 21-cm background radiation, which traces the collective emission from all sources of ultraviolet and X-ray photons before reionization is complete. While ultraviolet (UV) photons from Pop III stars can, in principle, shift the onset of radiative coupling of the 21-cm transition - and potentially reionization - to early times, we find that the remnants of Pop III stars are likely to have a more discernible impact on the 21-cm signal than Pop III stars themselves. The X-rays from such sources preferentially heat the intergalactic medium (IGM) at early times, which elongates the epoch of reheating and results in a more gradual transition from an absorption signal to emission. This gradual heating gives rise to broad, asymmetric wings in the absorption signal, which stand in contrast to the relatively sharp, symmetric signals that arise in models treating Pop II sources only. A stronger signature of Pop III, in which the position of the absorption minimum becomes inconsistent with Pop II-only models, requires extreme star-forming events that may not be physically plausible, lending further credence to predictions of relatively high-frequency absorption troughs, {$\nu$}\textsubscript{min }{\~ } 100 MHz. As a result, though the trough location alone may not be enough to indicate the presence of Pop III, the asymmetric wings should arise even if only a few Pop III stars form in each halo before the transition to Pop II star formation occurs, provided that the Pop III IMF is sufficiently top-heavy and at least some Pop III stars form in binaries.},

While its anomalous amplitude may indicate new physics, in this work we focus on the timing of the signal, as it alone provides an important constraint on galaxy formation models. Although rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) over a broad range of redshifts are well fit by simple models in which galaxy star formation histories track the assembly of dark matter haloes, we find that these same models, with reasonable assumptions about X-ray production in star-forming galaxies, cannot generate a narrow absorption trough at z{\~ } 18. If verified, the EDGES signal therefore requires the fundamental inputs of galaxy formation models to evolve rapidly at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10. Unless extremely faint sources residing in haloes below the atomic cooling threshold are responsible for the EDGES signal, star formation in {\~\{} \vphantom\{\} 10\^8-10\^\{10\} M\_\{{$\Sun$} \} haloes must be more efficient than expected, implying that the faint end of the UVLF at M\textsubscript{UV} {$\lessequivlnt$} -12 must steepen at the highest redshifts. This steepening provides a concrete test for future galaxy surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope and ongoing efforts in lensed fields, and is required regardless of whether the amplitude of the EDGES signal is due to new cooling channels or a strong radio background in the early Universe. However, the radio background solution requires that galaxies at z \&gt; 15 emit 1-2 GHz photons with an efficiency {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10\textsuperscript{2} times greater than local star-forming galaxies, posing a challenge for models of low-frequency photon production in the early Universe.},

The statistical distribution of dark haloes within the initial density field (assumed Gaussian) is determined by an extension of the Press-Schechter formalism. Modifications of this distribution caused by gravitationally induced motions are treated using a spherical collapse approximation. We test this model against results from a variety of N-body simulations, and find that it gives an accurate description of a bias function, b(M, R, delta)=delta\_h(M, R, delta)/delta, where delta\_h(M, R, delta) is the mean overdensity of haloes of mass M within spheres which have radius R and mass overdensity delta the results depend only very weakly on how haloes are identified in the simulations. This bias function is sufficient to calculate the cross-correlation between dark haloes and mass, and again we find excellent agreement between simulation results and analytic predictions. Because haloes are spatially exclusive, the variance in the count of objects within spheres of fixed radius and overdensity is significantly smaller than the Poisson value. This seriously complicates any analytic calculation of the autocorrelation function of dark haloes. Our simulation results show, however, that this autocorrelation function is proportional to that of the mass over a wide range in R, even including scales where both functions are significantly greater than unity. Furthermore, the constant of proportionality is very close to that predicted on large scales by the analytic model. Since analytic formulae for the non-linear autocorrelation function of the mass are already known, this result permits an entirely analytic estimate of the autocorrelation function of dark haloes. We use our model to study how the distribution of galaxies may be biased with respect to that of the mass. In conjunction with other data these techniques should make it possible to measure the amplitude of cosmic mass fluctuations and the density of the Universe.},

  abstract = {We develop an extension of \textbackslash textit\{the Halo Model\} that describes analytically the corrections to the matter power spectrum due to the physics of baryons. We extend these corrections to the weak-lensing shear angular power spectrum. Within each halo, our baryonic model accounts for: 1) a central galaxy, the major stellar component whose properties are derived from abundance matching techniques; 2) a hot plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium and 3) an adiabatically-contracted dark matter component. This analytic approach allows us to compare our model to the dark-matter-only case. Our basic assumptions are tested against the hydrodynamical simulations of Martizzi et. al. (2014), with which a remarkable agreement is found. Our baryonic model has only one free parameter, \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm crit\}\$, the critical halo mass that marks the transition between feedback-dominated halos, mostly devoid of gas, and gas rich halos, in which AGN feedback effects become weaker. We explore the entire cosmological parameter space, using the angular power spectrum in three redshift bins as the observable, assuming a Euclid-like survey. We derive the corresponding constraints on the cosmological parameters, as well as the possible bias introduced by neglecting the effects of baryonic physics. We find that, up to \$\textbackslash ell\_\{max\}\$=4000, baryonic physics plays very little role in the cosmological parameters estimation. However, if one goes up to \$\textbackslash ell\_\{max\}\$=8000, the marginalized errors on the cosmological parameters can be significantly reduced, but neglecting baryonic physics can lead to bias in the recovered cosmological parameters up to 10\$\textbackslash sigma\$. These biases are removed if one takes into account the main baryonic parameter, \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm crit\}\$, which can also be determined up to 1-2\textbackslash\%, along with the other cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {The non-Gaussian nature of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal has a significant impact on the error variance of its power spectrum \$\{P\_\{\textbackslash rm b\}\}(\{\textbackslash bf k\})\$ (Mondal et al., 2015). Building on the previous work, we have used a large ensemble of semi-numerical simulations and an analytical model to estimate the effect of this non-Gaussianity on the entire error covariance matrix \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\}\_\{ij\}\$. Our analytical model shows that \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\}\_\{ij\}\$ has contributions from two sources. One is the usual variance for a Gaussian random field which scales inversely of the number of modes that goes into the estimation of \$\{P\_\{\textbackslash rm b\}\}(\{\textbackslash bf k\})\$. The other is the trispectrum of the signal. Using the simulated 21-cm signal ensemble, an ensemble of the randomized signal and ensembles of Gaussian random ensembles we have quantified the effect of the trispectrum on the error variance \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\}\_\{ij\}\$. We find that its relative contribution is comparable to or larger than that of the Gaussian term for the \$k\$ range \$0.3 \textbackslash leq k \textbackslash leq 1.0 \textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, and can be even \$\textbackslash sim 200\$ times larger at \$k \textbackslash sim 5\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. We also establish that the off-diagonal terms of \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\}\_\{ij\}\$ have statistically significant non-zero values which arise purely from the trispectrum. This further signifies that the error in different \$k\$ modes are not independent. We find a strong correlation between the errors at large \$k\$ values \$(\textbackslash ge 0.5 \textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\})\$, and a weak correlation between the smallest and largest \$k\$ values. There is also a small anti-correlation between the errors in the smallest and intermediate \$k\$ values. These results are relevant for the \$k\$ range that will be probed by the current and upcoming EoR 21-cm experiments.},

In the first part of this paper, we present a method to properly incorporate the LC effect in simulations of the EoR 21-cm signal that include peculiar velocities. Subsequently, we discuss how to quantify the second order statistics of the EoR 21-cm signal in the presence of the LC effect. We demonstrate that the 3D power spectrum \$P(\{\textbackslash bf\{k\}\})\$ fails to quantify the entire information because it assumes the signal to be ergodic and periodic, whereas the LC effect breaks these conditions along the LoS. Considering a LC simulation centered at redshift \$8\$ where the mean neutral fraction drops from \$0.65\$ to \$0.35\$ across the box, we find that \$P(\{\textbackslash bf\{k\}\})\$ misses out \$\textbackslash sim 40 \textbackslash\%\$ of the information at the two ends of the \$17.41 \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm MHz\}\$ simulation bandwidth.

However, current uncertainties in the antenna and receiver reflection coefficients can lead to residuals of up to \$20\$ mK even in low-foreground sky regions.

We perform numerical simulations of the formation of dark matter haloes, each containing {$>\sptilde$}106 particles and resolved to 0.003 times the virial radius, allowing an accurate comparison with rotation curve data. A good fit to both Galactic and cluster-sized haloes can be achieved using the density profile {$\rho$}(r)\textasciitilde [(rrs)1.5(1+(rrs)1.5)] -1, where rs is a scale radius. This profile has a steeper asymptotic slope, {$\rho$}(r)\textasciitilde r-1.5, and a sharper turn-over than found by lower resolution studies. The central structure of relaxed haloes that form within a hierarchical universe has a remarkably small scatter. We compare the results with a sample of dark matter dominated, low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies with circular velocities in the range 100-300kms-1. The rotation curves of discs within cold dark matter haloes rise too steeply to match these data, which require a constant mass density in the central regions. The effects of {$\Omega$}mass and {$\Lambda$} cannot reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM) model with data - even if we leave the concentration as a free parameter, we are unable to reproduce the observations with such a steep central density profile. It is important to confirm these results using stellar rather than Hi rotation curves for LSB galaxies. We test the effects of introducing a cut-off in the power spectrum that may occur in a universe dominated by warm dark matter. In this case, haloes form by a monolithic collapse but the final density profile barely changes, demonstrating that the merger history does not play a role in determining the halo structure.},

While SIDM virialized halos are more nearly spherical than CDM halos, they can be rotationally flattened by as much as 20\% in their inner regions. Substructure halos suffer ram-pressure truncation and drag, which are more rapid and severe than their gravitational counterparts tidal stripping and dynamical friction. Lensing constraints on the size of galactic halos in clusters are a factor of 2 smaller than predicted by gravitational stripping, and the recent detection of tidal streams of stars escaping from the satellite galaxy Carina suggests that its tidal radius is close to its optical radius of a few hundred parsecs-an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by CDM models but consistent with SIDM models. The orbits of SIDM satellites suffer significant velocity bias, {$\sigma$}SIDM/{$\sigma$}CDM=0.85, and are more circular than CDM satellites, {$\beta$}SIDM\textasciitilde 0.5, in agreement with the inferred orbits of the Galaxy's satellites. In the limit of a short mean free path, SIDM halos have singular isothermal density profiles; thus, in its simplest incarnation SIDM, is inconsistent with galactic rotation curves.},

  abstract = {Polarized foreground emission is a potential contaminant of attempts to  measure the fluctuation power spectrum of highly redshifted 21 cm HI emission from the epoch of reionization. Using the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), we present limits on the observed power spectra of all four Stokes parameters in two frequency bands, centered at 126 MHz (\$z=10.3\$) and 164 MHz (\$z=7.66\$) for a three-month observing campaign of a 32-antenna deployment, for which unpolarized power spectrum results have been reported at \$z=7.7\$ (Parsons et al 2014) and \$7.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 10.5\$ (Jacobs et al 2014). The power spectra in this paper are processed in the same way as in those works, and show no definitive detection of polarized power. This non-detection appears to be largely due to the suppression of polarized power by ionospheric rotation measure fluctuations, which strongly affect Stokes Q and U. We are able to show that the net effect of polarized leakage is a negligible contribution at the levels of of the limits reported in Parsons et al 2014 and Jacobs et al 2014.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the potential for statistical epoch of reionization (EOR) measurements using wide field radio observations. New developments in low frequency radio instrumentation and signal processing allow very sensitive EOR measurements, and the analysis techniques enabled by these advances offer natural ways of separating the EOR signal from the residual foreground emission. This paper introduces the enabling technologies and proposes an analysis technique designed to make optimal use of the capabilities of next generation low frequency radio arrays. The observations we propose can directly observe the power spectrum of the EOR using relatively short observations, and are significantly more sensitive than other techniques which have been discussed in the literature. For example, in the absence of foreground contamination the measurements we propose would produce five 3-sigma power spectrum points in 100 hours of observation with only 4 MHz bandwidth with LOFAR for simple models of the high redshift 21cm emission. The challenge of residual foreground removal may be addressed by the symmetries in the three-dimensional (two spatial frequencies and radiofrequency) radio interferometric data. These symmetries naturally separate the EOR signal from most classes of residual un-subtracted foreground contamination, including all foreground continuum sources and radio line emission from the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {21 cm power spectrum observations have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization and Dark Energy, but require extraordinarily precise data analysis methods to separate the cosmological signal from the astrophysical and instrumental contaminants. This analysis challenge has led to a diversity of proposed analyses, including delay spectra, imaging power spectra, m-mode analysis, and numerous others. This diversity of approach is a strength, but has also led to confusion within the community about whether insights gleaned by one group are applicable to teams working in different analysis frameworks. In this paper we show that all existing analysis proposals can be classified into two distinct families based on whether they estimate the power spectrum of the measured or reconstructed sky. This subtle difference in the statistical question posed largely determines the susceptibility of the analyses to foreground emission and calibration errors, and ultimately the science different analyses can pursue. In this paper we detail the origin of the two analysis families, categorize the analyses being actively developed, and explore their relative sensitivities to foreground contamination and calibration errors.},

  abstract = {The friends-of-friends algorithm (hereafter FOF) is a percolation  algorithm which is routinely used to identify dark matter halos from N-body simulations. We use results from percolation theory to show that the boundary of FOF halos does not correspond to a single density threshold but to a range of densities close to a critical value that depends upon the linking length parameter, b. We show that for the commonly used choice of b = 0.2, this critical density is equal to 81.62 times the mean matter density. Consequently, halos identified by the FOF algorithm enclose an average overdensity which depends on their density profile (concentration) and therefore changes with halo mass, contrary to the popular belief that the average overdensity is \textasciitilde 180. We derive an analytical expression for the overdensity as a function of the linking length parameter b and the concentration of the halo. Results of tests carried out using simulated and actual FOF halos identified in cosmological simulations show excellent agreement with our analytical prediction. We also find that the mass of the halo that the FOF algorithm selects crucially depends upon mass resolution. We find a percolation-theory-motivated formula that is able to accurately correct for the dependence on number of particles for the mock realizations of spherical and triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White halos. However, we show that this correction breaks down when applied to the real cosmological FOF halos due to the presence of substructures. Given that abundance of substructure depends on redshift and cosmology, we expect that the resolution effects due to substructure on the FOF mass and halo mass function will also depend on redshift and cosmology and will be difficult to correct for in general. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the universality of the mass function.},

The target distribution is first transformed into a diagonal, unit variance Gaussian by a series of non-linear, invertible, and non-volume preserving flows. Neural networks are extremely expressive, and can transform complex targets to a simple latent representation. Efficient proposals can then be made in this space, and we demonstrate a high degree of mixing on several challenging distributions. Parameter space can naturally be split into a block diagonal speed hierarchy, allowing for fast exploration of subspaces where it is inexpensive to evaluate the likelihood. Using this method, we develop a nested MCMC sampler to perform Bayesian inference and model comparison, finding excellent performance on highly curved and multi-modal analytic likelihoods. We also test it on \{\textbackslash em Planck\} 2015 data, showing accurate parameter constraints, and calculate the evidence for simple one-parameter extensions to LCDM in \$\textbackslash sim20\$ dimensional parameter space.

Using recently re-calibrated DEEP2 SFRs from restframe B-band magnitude and optical colors, we find that within the blue galaxy population at z \textasciitilde{} 1 the clustering amplitude increases strongly with increasing SFR and decreasing sSFR. For red galaxies there is no significant correlation between clustering amplitude and either SFR or sSFR. Blue galaxies with high SFR or low sSFR are as clustered on large scales as red galaxies. We find that the clustering trend observed with SFR can be explained mostly, but not entirely, by the correlation between stellar mass and clustering amplitude for blue galaxies. We also show that galaxies above the star-forming "main sequence" are less clustered than galaxies below the main sequence, at a given stellar mass. These results are not consistent with the high-sSFR population being dominated by major mergers. We also measure the clustering amplitude on small scales ({$<$}=0.3 h -1 Mpc) and find an enhanced clustering signal relative to the best-fit large-scale power law for red galaxies with high stellar mass, blue galaxies with high SFR, and both red and blue galaxies with high sSFR. The increased small-scale clustering for galaxies with high sSFRs is likely linked to triggered star formation in interacting galaxies. These measurements provide strong constraints on galaxy evolution and halo occupation distribution models at z \textasciitilde{} 1.},

We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the SDSS at z=0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low mass halos, the SHM ratio is lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the stellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at all redshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for massive galaxies than for low mass ones. We present convenient fitting functions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.},

Recently it has been discovered that EROs are strongly clustered. Are these objects the high-redshift progenitors of present day giant ellipticals (gEs)? Are they already massive at this epoch? Are they the descendents of the \$z\textbackslash sim3\$ Lyman Break Galaxies (LBG), which have also been identified as possible high redshift progenitors of giant ellipticals? We address these questions within the framework of the Cold Dark Matter paradigm using an analytic model that connects the number density and clustering or bias of an observed population with the halo occupation function (the number of observed galaxies per halo of a given mass). We find that EROs reside in massive dark matter halos, with average mass {$>$} 1E13/h100 Msun. The occupation function that we derive for EROs is very similar to the one we derive for z=0, L{$>$}L* early type galaxies, whereas the occupation function for LBGs is skewed towards much smaller host halo masses ( \textasciitilde{} 1E11 to 1E12/h100 Msun.

Within the studied redshift range, the relation between the halo shape and mass can be well fitted by a redshift-dependent power law.

In particular, the first claimed 21-cm detection exhibits a deeper global absorption feature than expected, which could be caused by a low baryonic temperature, and has been interpreted as a sign for electromagnetic interactions between baryons and dark matter. This hypothesis has a striking prediction: large temperature anisotropies sourced by the velocity-dependent cooling of the baryons. However, in order to remain consistent with the rest of cosmological observations, only part of the dark matter is allowed to be charged and thus interactive. Here we compute, for the first time, the 21-cm fluctuations caused by a charged subcomponent of the dark matter, including both the pre- and postrecombination evolution of all fluids. We find that, for the same parameters that can explain the anomalous 21-cm absorption signal, any percent-level fraction of charged dark matter would source novel 21-cm fluctuations with a unique acoustic spectrum, and with an amplitude above any other known effects. These fluctuations are uncorrelated with the usual adiabatic anisotropies, and would be observable at high significance with interferometers such as the Low-Frequency Array and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, thus providing a novel probe of dark matter at cosmic dawn.},

  abstract = {The parameters governing the standard {$\delta$} cold dark matter cosmological model have been constrained with unprecedented accuracy by precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck satellites. Each new data release has refined further our knowledge of quantities - such as the matter density parameter {$\Omega$}M - that are imprinted on the dark matter halo mass function (HMF), a powerful probe of dark matter and dark energy models. In this Letter, we trace how changes in the cosmological parameters over the last decade have influenced uncertainty in our knowledge of the HMF. We show that this uncertainty has reduced significantly since the third WMAP data release, but the rate of this reduction is slowing. This is limited by uncertainty in the normalization {$\sigma$}8, whose influence is most pronounced at the high-mass end of the mass function. Interestingly, we find that the accuracy with which we can constrain the HMF in terms of the cosmological parameters has now reached the point at which it is comparable to the scatter in HMF fitting functions. This suggests that the power of the HMF as a precision probe of dark matter and dark energy hinges on more accurate determination of the theoretical HMF. Finally, we assess prospects of using the HMF to differentiate between cold and warm dark matter models based on ongoing improvements in measurements of {$\Omega$}M, and we comment briefly on optimal survey strategies for constraining dark matter and dark energy models using the HMF. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {We present a sophisticated statistical point-source foreground model for low-frequency radio Epoch of Reionization (EoR) experiments using the 21 cm neutral hydrogen emission line. Motivated by our understanding of the low-frequency radio sky, we enhance the realism of two model components compared with existing models: the source count distributions as a function of flux density and spatial position (source clustering), extending current formalisms for the foreground covariance of 2D power-spectral modes in 21 cm EoR experiments. The former we generalize to an arbitrarily broken power law, and the latter to an arbitrary isotropically correlated field. This paper presents expressions for the modified covariance under these extensions, and shows that for a more realistic source spatial distribution, extra covariance arises in the EoR window that was previously unaccounted for. Failure to include this contribution can yield bias in the final power-spectrum and under-estimate uncertainties, potentially leading to a false detection of signal. The extent of this effect is uncertain, owing to ignorance of physical model parameters, but we show that it is dependent on the relative abundance of faint sources, to the effect that our extension will become more important for future deep surveys. Finally, we show that under some parameter choices, ignoring source clustering can lead to false detections on large scales, due to both the induced bias and an artificial reduction in the estimated measurement uncertainty.},

As such, it is a key goal of current and future deep optical surveys to constrain the mass function down to mass scales that typically host \{L\}\textsubscript{\textbackslash star } galaxies. Motivated by the proven accuracy of Press-Schechter-type mass functions, we introduce a related but purely empirical form consistent with standard formulae to better than 4\% in the medium-mass regime, \{10\}\textsuperscript{10}\{--\}\{10\}\textsuperscript{13} \{h\}\textsuperscript{-1} \{M\}\textsubscript{{$\Sun$} }. In particular, our form consists of four parameters, each of which has a simple interpretation, and can be directly related to parameters of the galaxy distribution, such as \{L\}\textsubscript{\textbackslash star }. Using this form within a hierarchical Bayesian likelihood model, we show how individual mass-measurement errors can be successfully included in a typical analysis, while accounting for Eddington bias. We apply our form to a question of survey design in the context of a semi-realistic data model, illustrating how it can be used to obtain optimal balance between survey depth and angular coverage for constraints on mass function parameters.

Its familiar form disentangles a great deal of systematic information concerning both the sky and telescope and is displayed as a foreground-dominated ``brick'' and ``wedge'' on large line-of-sight scales and a complementary ``window'' on smaller scales. This paper builds on many previous works in the literature that seek to elucidate the varied instrumental and foreground factors that contribute to these familiar structures in the 2D power spectrum. In particular, we consider the effects of uv sampling on the emergence of the wedge. Our results verify the expectation that arbitrarily dense instrument layouts in principle restore the missing information that leads to mode mixing and can therefore mitigate the wedge feature. We derive rule-of-thumb estimates for the required baseline density for complete wedge mitigation, showing that these will be unachievable in practice. We also discuss the optimal shape of the layout, showing that logarithmic regularity in the radial separation of baselines is favorable. While complete suppression of foreground leakage into the wedge is practically unachievable, we find that designing layouts that promote radial density and regularity is able to reduce the amplitude of foreground power by one to three orders of magnitude.},

Using simple, phenomenologically motivated forms for both functions that depend only on a single halo property, we demonstrate the model's ability to reproduce the z = 0 red and blue stellar mass functions. Furthermore, by adding redshift as a second input variable to the physics function we show that the reproduction of the global stellar mass function out to z = 3 is improved. We conclude by discussing the general utility of our new model, highlighting its usefulness for creating mock galaxy samples which have a number of key advantages over those generated by other techniques.},

Observations reveal smooth halos with central density cores. One possible resolution of the substructure problem is that the dark matter is warm; this will suppress the power spectrum on small scales. The Ly{$\alpha$} forest is a powerful probe of the linear power spectrum on these scales. We use collisionless N-body simulations to follow the evolution of structure in warm dark matter (WDM) models and analyze artificial Ly{$\alpha$} forest spectra extracted from them. By requiring that there be enough small-scale power in the linear power spectrum to reproduce the observed properties of the Ly{$\alpha$} forest in quasar spectra, we derive a lower limit to the mass of the WDM particle of 750 eV. This limit is robust to reasonable uncertainties in our assumption about the temperature of the gas at mean density (T0) at z=3. We argue that any model that suppresses the CDM linear theory power spectrum more severely than a 750 eV WDM particle cannot produce the Ly{$\alpha$} forest.},

To move toward more realistic scenarios, we explore the effects of applying more realistic foreground and instrument models to the 21 cm signal, as well as the ability to estimate astrophysical parameters with these additional complexities. We use a highly optimized version of 21cm FAST, integrated into 21cm MC, to generate lightcones of the brightness temperature fluctuation for Bayesian parameter estimation. We include a statistical point-source foreground model and an instrument model based on the Murchison Widefield Array scaled in observation time to have an effective sensitivity similar to the future Square Kilometre Array. We also extend the current likelihood prescription to account for the presence of beam convolution and foregrounds, the two-dimensional power spectrum (PS), and the correlation of PS modes. We use frequency bands between 150 and 180 MHz to constrain the ionizing efficiency ({$\zeta$}), the minimum virial temperature of halos ( \$\{T\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{vir\}\}\$ ), the soft X-ray emissivity per unit star formation rate (SFR) (LX/SFR), and the X-ray energy threshold (E0). We find that the inclusion of realistic foregrounds and instrumental components biases the parameter constraints, due to unaccounted for cross-power between the EoR signal, foregrounds, and thermal noise. This causes estimates of {$\zeta$} to be biased by up to 5{$\sigma$}, but the estimates of Tvir, LX/SFR and E0 remain unaffected and are all within 1{$\sigma$}.},

Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

  abstract = {We investigate the mass profile of cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) haloes using a suite of numerical simulations spanning five decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters. These haloes typically have a few million particles within the virial radius (r200), allowing robust mass profile estimates down to radii {$<$}1 per cent of r200. Our analysis confirms the proposal of Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) that the shape of the {$\Lambda$}CDM halo mass profiles differs strongly from a power law and depends little on mass. The logarithmic slope of the spherically averaged density profile, as measured by {$\beta$}=-dln{$\rho$}/dlnr, decreases monotonically towards the centre and becomes shallower than isothermal ({$\beta$} {$<$} 2) inside a characteristic radius, r-2. The fitting formula proposed by NFW provides a reasonably good approximation to the density and circular velocity profiles of individual haloes; circular velocities typically deviate from NFW best fits by {$<$}10 per cent over the radial range that is numerically well resolved. Alternatively, systematic deviations from the NFW best fits are also noticeable. Inside r-2, the profile of simulated haloes becomes shallower with radius more gradually than predicted and, as a result, NFW fits tend to underestimate the dark matter density in these regions. This discrepancy has been interpreted as indicating a steeply divergent cusp with asymptotic inner slope, {$\beta$}0{$\equiv\beta$}(r\hphantom{0}= 0) \textasciitilde{} 1.5. Our results suggest a different interpretation. We use the density and enclosed mass at our innermost resolved radii to place strong constraints on {$\beta$}0: density cusps as steep as r-1.5 are inconsistent with most of our simulations, although {$\beta$}0= 1 is still consistent with our data. Our density profiles show no sign of converging to a well-defined asymptotic inner power law. We propose a simple formula that reproduces the radial dependence of the slope better than the NFW profile, and so may minimize errors when extrapolating our results inward to radii not yet reliably probed by numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {We study the mass, velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) haloes using a suite of N-body simulations of unprecedented numerical resolution. The Aquarius Project follows the formation of six different galaxy-sized haloes simulated several times at varying numerical resolution, allowing numerical convergence to be assessed directly. The highest resolution simulation represents a single dark matter halo using 4.4 billion particles, of which 1.1 billion end up within the virial radius. Our analysis confirms a number of results claimed by earlier work, and clarifies a few issues where conflicting claims may be found in the recent literature. The mass profile of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes deviates slightly but systematically from the form proposed by Navarro, Frenk \& White. The spherically averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower inwards and, at the innermost resolved radius, the logarithmic slope is {$\gamma$} {$\equiv$} - d ln {$\rho$}/d ln r {$<\sptilde$} 1. Asymptotic inner slopes as steep as the recently claimed {$\rho$} \textasciitilde{} r-1.2 are clearly ruled out. The radial dependence of {$\gamma$} is well approximated by a power law, {$\gamma$} \textasciitilde{} r{$\alpha$} (the Einasto profile). The shape parameter, {$\alpha$}, varies slightly but significantly from halo to halo, implying that the mass profiles of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes are not strictly universal: different haloes cannot, in general, be rescaled to look identical. Departures from similarity are also seen in velocity dispersion profiles and correlate with those in density profiles so as to preserve a power-law form for the spherically averaged pseudo-phase-space density, {$\rho$}/{$\sigma$}3 \textasciitilde{} r-1.875. The index here is identical to that of Bertschinger's similarity solution for self-similar infall on to a point mass from an otherwise uniform Einstein-de Sitter universe. The origin of this striking behaviour is unclear, but its robustness suggests that it reflects a fundamental structural property of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes. Our conclusions are reliable down to radii below 0.4 per cent of the virial radius, providing well-defined predictions for halo structure when baryonic effects are neglected, and thus an instructive theoretical template against which the modifications induced by the baryonic components of real galaxies can be judged.},

  abstract = {The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a radio interferometer aiming to detect the power spectrum of 21cm fluctuations from neutral hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EOR). Drawing on lessons from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), HERA is a hexagonal array of large (14m diameter) dishes with suspended dipole feeds. Not only does the dish determine overall sensitivity, it affects the observed frequency structure of foregrounds in the interferometer. This is the first of a series of four papers characterizing the frequency and angular response of the dish with simulations and measurements. We focus in this paper on the angular response (i.e., power pattern), which sets the relative weighting between sky regions of high and low delay, and thus, apparent source frequency structure. We measure the angular response at 137MHz using the ORBCOMM beam mapping system of Neben et al. We measure a collecting area of 93m\^2 in the optimal dish/feed configuration, implying HERA-320 should detect the EOR power spectrum at z=9 with a signal-to-noise ratio of 19.3 using a foreground avoidance approach, and 74.3 using a foreground subtraction approach. Lastly we study the impact of these beam measurements on the distribution of foregrounds in Fourier space.},

  abstract = {The observed two-point angular correlation function, w(theta), of mJy radio sources exhibits the puzzling feature of a power-law behaviour up to very large (almost 10 degrees) angular scales which cannot be accounted for in the standard hierarchical clustering scenario for any realistic redshift distribution of such sources. After having discarded the possibility that the signal can be explained by a high density local source population, we find no alternatives to assuming that - at variance with all the other extragalactic populations studied so far, and in particular with optically selected quasars - radio sources responsible for the large-scale clustering signal were increasingly less clustered with increasing look-back time, up to at least z=1. The data are accurately accounted for in terms of a bias function which decreases with increasing redshift, mirroring the evolution with cosmic time of the characteristic halo mass, M\_\{star\}, entering the non linear regime. In the framework of the `concordance cosmology', the effective halo mass controlling the bias parameter is found to decrease from about 10\^\{15\} M\_\{sun\}/h at z=0 to the value appropriate for optically selected quasars, 10\^\{13\} M\_\{sun\}/h, at z=1.5. This suggests that, in the redshift range probed by the data, the clustering evolution of radio sources is ruled by the growth of large-scale structure, and that they are associated with the densest environments virializing at any cosmic epoch. The data provide only loose constraints on radio source clustering at z{$>$}1 so we cannot rule out the possibility that at these redshifts the clustering evolution of radio sources enters a different regime, perhaps similar to that found for optically selected quasars. The dependence of w(theta) on cosmological parameters is also discussed.},

  abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation (MS) to study the statistics of {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) halo concentrations at z = 0. Our results confirm that the average halo concentration declines monotonically with mass; the concentration-mass relation is well fitted by a power law over three decades in mass, up to the most massive objects that form in a {$\Lambda$}CDM universe (\textasciitilde{} 1015h-1Msolar). This is in clear disagreement with the predictions of the model proposed by Bullock et al. for these rare objects, and agrees better with the original predictions of Navarro, Frenk \& White. The large volume surveyed, together with the unprecedented numerical resolution of the MS, allows us to estimate with confidence the distribution of concentrations and, consequently, the abundance of systems with unusual properties. About one in a hundred cluster haloes (M200 {$>\sptilde$} 3 \texttimes{} 1014h-1Msolar) have concentrations exceeding c200 = 7.5, a result that may be useful in interpreting the likelihood of unusually strong massive gravitational lenses, such as Abell 1689, in the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmogony. A similar fraction of about 1 per cent of galaxy-sized haloes (M200 \textasciitilde{} 1012h-1Msolar) have c200 {$<$} 4.5 and this could be relevant to models that attempt to reconcile the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies by appealing to haloes of unexpectedly low concentration. We find that halo concentrations are independent of spin once haloes manifestly out of equilibrium have been removed from the sample. Compared to their relaxed brethren, the concentrations of out-of-equilibrium haloes tend to be lower and have more scatter, while their spins tend to be higher. A number of previously noted trends within the halo population are induced primarily by these properties of unrelaxed systems. Finally, we compare the result of predicting halo concentrations using the mass assembly history of the main progenitor with predictions based on simple arguments regarding the assembly time of all progenitors. The latter are typically as good or better than the former, suggesting that halo concentration depends not only on the evolutionary path of a halo's main progenitor, but on how and when all of its constituents collapsed to form non-linear objects.},

In the current cosmological paradigm, a dark-matter-sheet 3D manifold, inhabiting 6D position-velocity phase space, was flat (with vanishing velocity) at the big bang. Afterward, gravity stretched and bunched the sheet together in different places, forming a cosmic web when projected to the position coordinates. Here, I explain some properties of an origami approximation, in which the sheet does not stretch or contract (an assumption that is false in general), but is allowed to fold. Even without stretching, the sheet can form an idealized cosmic web, with convex polyhedral voids separated by straight walls and filaments, joined by convex polyhedral nodes. The nodes form in 'polygonal' or 'polyhedral' collapse, somewhat like spherical/ellipsoidal collapse, except incorporating simultaneous filament and wall formation. The origami approximation allows phase-space geometries of nodes, filaments, and walls to be more easily understood, and may aid in understanding spin correlations between nearby galaxies. This contribution explores kinematic origami-approximation models giving velocity fields for the first time.},

By using the outputs of \$N\$-body simulations and the halo catalogs extracted in the range of \$z=[0,1.48]\$, we develop an emulator, Dark Emulator, which enables fast and accurate computations of halo clustering quantities, the halo mass function, halo-matter cross-correlation, and halo auto-correlation as a function of halo masses, redshift, separations and cosmological models, based on the Principal Component Analysis and the Gaussian Process Regression for the large-dimensional input and output data vector. We use a validation set of \$N\$-body simulations for cosmological models, which are not used in training the emulator, to assess the performance of the emulator. We show that, for typical halos hosting CMASS galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the emulator predicts the halo-matter cross correlation, relevant for galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with an accuracy better than \$2\textbackslash\%\$ and the halo auto-correlation, relevant for galaxy clustering correlation, with an accuracy better than \$4\textbackslash\%\$. We give several demonstrations of the emulator. For instance, the emulator outputs can be used to study properties of halo mass density profiles such as the mass-concentration relation and splashback radius and their cosmology and redshift dependences. We also show that the emulator outputs can be combined with an analytical prescription of halo-galaxy connection such as the halo occupation distribution at the equation level, instead of using the mock catalogs, to make accurate predictions of galaxy clustering statistics such as the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and the projected correlation function for any model within the \$w\$CDM cosmologies, with a CPU time of a few seconds.},

Multi-wavelength observations of clusters are now underway to better constrain masses both for individual clusters and ensembles of clusters. However, many of these cluster mass measurements have been found to have correlated scatter, which can lead to measurement errors and/or bias if not accounted for. We consider mock observational mass measurements of galaxy clusters in a high resolution N-body simulation to better understand how scatters of different mass measurements are related to each other and how physical and observational properties of galaxy clusters are connected to these scatters. By observing each cluster from 96 different directions, we find the range of scatters for each observational method and use principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the combinations of mass measurements which maximize and minimize these mass scatters. We then find the correlation of these scatters with the physical cluster or environmental properties. We also consider the ensemble of clusters, and discuss outliers and what physical and observational properties might distinguish them.},

  abstract = {A critical challenge in the observation of the redshifted 21-cm line is its separation from bright Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. In particular, the instrumental leakage of polarized foregrounds, which undergo significant Faraday rotation as they propagate through the interstellar medium, may harmfully contaminate the 21-cm power spectrum. We develop a formalism to describe the leakage due to instrumental widefield effects in visibility--based power spectra measured with redundant arrays, extending the delay--spectrum approach presented in Parsons et al. (2012). We construct polarized sky models and propagate them through the instrument model to simulate realistic full--sky observations with the Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization. We find that the leakage due to a population of polarized point sources is expected to be higher than diffuse Galactic polarization at any \$k\$ mode for a 30\textasciitilde m reference baseline. For the same reference baseline, a foreground--free window at \$k {$>$} 0.3 \textbackslash, h\$\textasciitilde Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ can be defined in terms of leakage from diffuse Galactic polarization even under the most pessimistic assumptions. If measurements of polarized foreground power spectra or a model of polarized foregrounds are given, our method is able to predict the polarization leakage in actual 21-cm observations, potentially enabling its statistical subtraction from the measured 21-cm power spectrum.},

The MML method is free of binning and natively accounts for small number statistics and non-detections. Its fast implementation in the R-package dftools is equally applicable to other objects, such as haloes, groups, and clusters, as well as observables other than mass. The formalism readily extends to multidimensional distribution functions, e.g. a Choloniewski function for the galaxy mass-angular momentum distribution, also handled by dftools. The code provides uncertainties and covariances for the fitted model parameters and approximate Bayesian evidences. We use numerous mock surveys to illustrate and test the MML method, as well as to emphasize the necessity of accounting for observational uncertainties in MFs of modern galaxy surveys.},

A novel peeling scheme is used to subtract 2500 sources from the visibilities with ionospheric and beam corrections, resulting in the deepest, confusion-limited MWA image so far. The resulting spectra are found to be affected by instrumental effects, which limit the constraints that can be set on source-intrinsic spectral structure. The sensitivity and power-spectrum of the spectra are analysed, and it is found that the spectra of residuals are dominated by point spread function sidelobes from nearby undeconvolved sources.

We simulate realistic LOFAR data, and construct power spectra with convolutional gridding and w-stacking, w-projection, image domain gridding and without w-correction. These are compared against directly Fourier transformed data. The influence of oversampling, kernel size, w-quantization, kernel windowing function and image padding are quantified. The gridding excess power is measured with a foreground subtraction strategy, for which foregrounds have been subtracted using Gaussian progress regression, as well as with a foreground avoidance strategy. Constructing a power spectrum that has a bias significantly lower compared to the expected EoR signals is possible with the tested methods, but requires a kernel oversampling factor \&gt; 4000 and, when using w-correction, \&gt; 500 w-quantization levels. These values are higher than typical values used for imaging, but are computationally feasible. The kernel size and padding factor parameters are less crucial. Among the tested methods, image domain gridding shows the highest accuracy with the lowest imaging time. LOFAR 21-cm power spectrum results are not affected by gridding. Image domain gridding is overall the most suitable algorithm for 21-cm EoR experiments, including for future SKA EoR analyses. Nevertheless, convolutional gridding with tuned parameters results in sufficient accuracy. This holds also for w-stacking for wide-field imaging. The w-projection algorithm is less suitable because of the kernel oversampling requirements, and a faceting approach is unsuitable due to the resulting spatial discontinuities.},

  abstract = {We present new measurements of dark matter distributions in 25 X-ray luminous clusters by making a full use of the two-dimensional (2D) weak-lensing signals obtained from high-quality Subaru/Suprime-Cam imaging data. Our approach to directly compare the measured lensing shear pattern with elliptical model predictions allows us to extract new information on the mass distributions of individual clusters, such as the halo ellipticity and mass centroid. We find that these parameters on the cluster shape are little degenerate with cluster mass and concentration parameters. By combining the 2D fitting results for a subsample of 18 clusters, the elliptical shape of dark matter haloes is detected at significance level. The mean ellipticity is found to be , which is in excellent agreement with a theoretical prediction based on the standard collisionless cold dark matter model. The mass centroid can be constrained with a typical accuracy of arcsec (kpc) in radius for each cluster. The mass centroid position fairly well matches the position of the brightest cluster galaxy, with some clusters showing significant offsets. Thus, the 2D shear fitting method enables us to assess one of the most important systematic errors inherent in the stacked cluster weak-lensing technique, the mass centroid uncertainty. In addition, the shape of the dark mass distribution is found to be only weakly correlated with that of the member galaxy distribution or the brightest cluster galaxy. We carefully examine possible sources of systematic errors in our measurements including the effect of substructures, the cosmic shear contamination, fitting regions and the dilution effect, and find none of them to be significant. Our results demonstrate the power of high-quality imaging data for exploring the detailed spatial distribution of dark matter, which should improve the ability of future surveys to conduct cluster cosmology experiments.

It is an improved version of what we previously proposed in 1991. The transformation x={$\varphi$}(t) is such that it maps the interval (0,{$\infty$}) onto (-{$\infty$},{$\infty$}), and that, while the integrand after the transformation decreases double exponentially at large negative t, the points of the formula approaches to zeros of sin{$\omega$}x or cos{$\omega$}x double exponentially at large positive t. Then the trapezoidal formula with an equal mesh size is applied to the integral over (-{$\infty$},{$\infty$}) after the transformation, which gives an efficient quadrature formula for the Fourier-type integrals. The present transformation is improved in the sense that it can integrate a function f(z) with singularities in the finite z-plane more efficiently than the one previously proposed.},

Below \textasciitilde 6 arcminutes w(theta) is dominated by the size distribution of radio galaxies. A model of the size distribution of radio galaxies can account for this excess signal in w(theta). The amplitude of the cosmological clustering of radio sources is roughly constant at A\textasciitilde 0.001 from 3 to 40 mJy, but has increased to A\textasciitilde 0.007 at 200 mJy. This can be explained if powerful (FRII) radio galaxies probe more massive structures at z\textasciitilde 1 compared to average power radio galaxies, consistent with powerful high-z radio galaxies generally having massive (forming) elliptical hosts in rich cluster environments. For FRIIs we derive a spatial (comoving) correlation length of r\_0=14\textbackslash pm3 h\^\{-1\} Mpc. This is close to that measured for extremely red objects (EROs) associated with a population of old elliptical galaxies at z\textasciitilde 1 by Daddi et al. (2001). Based on their similar clustering properties, we propose that EROs and powerful radio galaxies may be the same systems seen at different evolutionary stages. Their r\_0 is \textasciitilde 2 times higher than that of QSOs at a similar redshift, and comparable to that of bright ellipticals locally. This suggests that r\_0 (comoving) of these galaxies has changed little from z\textasciitilde 1 to z=0, in agreement with current LCDM hierarchical models for clustering evolution of massive early-type galaxies. Alternatively, the clustering of radio galaxies can be explained by the galaxy conservation model. This then implies that radio galaxies of average power are the progenitors of the local early-type field population, while the most powerful radio galaxies will evolve into a present-day population with r\_0 similar to that of local rich clusters.},

  abstract = {Context. The XXL Survey is the largest survey carried out by the  XMM-Newton satellite and covers a total area of 50 square degrees distributed over two fields. It primarily aims at investigating the large-scale structures of the Universe using the distribution of galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei as tracers of the matter distribution. The survey will ultimately uncover several hundreds of galaxy clusters out to a redshift of \textasciitilde 2 at a sensitivity of \textasciitilde 10-14 erg s-1 cm-2 in the [0.5-2] keV band. Aims: This article presents the XXL bright cluster sample, a subsample of 100 galaxy clusters selected from the full XXL catalogue by setting a lower limit of 3 \texttimes{} 10-14 erg s-1 cm-2 on the source flux within a 1' aperture.  Methods: The selection function was estimated using a mixture of Monte Carlo simulations and analytical recipes that closely reproduce the source selection process. An extensive spectroscopic follow-up provided redshifts for 97 of the 100 clusters. We derived accurate X-ray parameters for all the sources. Scaling relations were self-consistently derived from the same sample in other publications of the series. On this basis, we study the number density, luminosity function, and spatial distribution of the sample. Results: The bright cluster sample consists of systems with masses between M500 = 7 \texttimes{} 1013 and 3 \texttimes{} 1014 M{$\odot$}, mostly located between z = 0.1 and 0.5. The observed sky density of clusters is slightly below the predictions from the WMAP9 model, and significantly below the prediction from the Planck 2015 cosmology. In general, within the current uncertainties of the cluster mass calibration, models with higher values of {$\sigma$}8 and/or {$\Omega$}M appear more difficult to accommodate. We provide tight constraints on the cluster differential luminosity function and find no hint of evolution out to z \textasciitilde{} 1. We also find strong evidence for the presence of large-scale structures in the XXL bright cluster sample and identify five new superclusters.

By extending a recent work by [1], we show how different aspects, such as the initial integration time, the definition of constant infinity and the criterion for the extrapolation method (how close the inverse of the overdensity has to be to zero at the collapse time) can lead to an erroneous estimation (a few per mill error which translates to a few percent in the mass function) of the key quantity in the spherical collapse model: the linear critical overdensity {$\delta$}c, which plays a crucial role for the mass function of halos. We provide a better recipe to adopt in designing a code suitable to a generic smooth dark energy model and we compare our numerical results with analytic predictions for the EdS and the {$\Lambda$}CDM models. We further discuss the evolution of {$\delta$}c for selected classes of dark energy models as a general test of the robustness of our implementation. We finally outline which modifications need to be taken into account to extend the code to more general classes of models, such as clustering dark energy models and non-minimally coupled models.},

Singular-value decomposition is used to remove the remaining broad-band RFI by identifying ground sources with large eigenvalues.

These fields probe small comoving volumes (\texttildelow 103 Mpc3) at high magnification ({$\mu$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10) and can detect otherwise inaccessible ultra-faint galaxies. Even a few galaxies found in such small volumes require a very high number density of collapsed dark matter (DM) haloes. This implies significant primordial power on small scales, allowing these observations to rule out popular alternatives to standard cold dark matter (CDM) models, such as warm dark matter (WDM). In this work, we analytically compute WDM halo mass functions at z = 10, including the effects of both particle free-streaming and residual velocity dispersion. We show that the two z {$\approx$} 10 galaxies already detected by the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) survey are sufficient to constrain the WDM particle mass to mx {$>$} 1 (0.9) keV at 68 per cent (95 per cent) confidence limit (for a thermal relic relativistic at decoupling). This limit depends only on the WDM halo mass function and, unlike previous constraints on mx, is independent of any astrophysical modelling. The forthcoming HST Frontier Fields can significantly tighten these constraints.},

Three different color selection criteria from the literature are analyzed to assess the consequences of using different criteria for selecting EROs. Specifically, our samples are (R - Ks ) {$>$} 5.0 (28, 724 galaxies), (I - Ks ) {$>$} 4.0 (22, 451 galaxies), and (I - [3.6]) {$>$} 5.0 (64, 370 galaxies). Magnitude-limited samples show the correlation length (r 0) to increase for more luminous EROs, implying a correlation with stellar mass. We can separate star-forming and passive ERO populations using the (Ks - [24]) and ([3.6] - [24]) colors to Ks = 18.4 and [3.6] = 17.5, respectively. Star-forming and passive EROs in magnitude-limited samples have different clustering properties and host dark halo masses and cannot be simply understood as a single population. Based on the clustering, we find that bright passive EROs are the likely progenitors of {$>\sptilde$} 4L* elliptical galaxies. Bright EROs with ongoing star formation were found to occupy denser environments than star-forming galaxies in the local universe, making these the likely progenitors of {$>\sptilde$} L* local ellipticals. This suggests that the progenitors of massive {$>\sptilde$} 4L* local ellipticals had stopped forming stars by z {$>\sptilde$} 1.2, but that the progenitors of less massive ellipticals (down to L*) can still show significant star formation at this epoch.},

  abstract = {Design optimization under uncertainty is notoriously difficult when the objective function is expensive to evaluate. State-of-the-art techniques, e.g, stochastic optimization or sampling average approximation, fail to learn exploitable patterns from collected data and require an excessive number of objective function evaluations. There is a need for techniques that alleviate the high cost of information acquisition and select sequential simulations optimally. In the field of deterministic single-objective unconstrained global optimization, the Bayesian global optimization (BGO) approach has been relatively successful in addressing the in- formation acquisition problem. BGO builds a probabilistic surrogate of the expensive objective function and uses it to define an information acquisition function (IAF) whose role is to quantify the merit of making new objective evaluations. Specifically, BGO iterates between making the observations with the largest expected IAF and rebuilding the probabilistic surrogate, until a convergence criterion is met. In this work, we extend the expected improvement (EI) IAF to the case of design optimization under uncertainty wherein the EI policy is reformulated to filter out parametric and measurement uncertainties. To increase the robustness of our approach in the low sample regime, we employ a fully Bayesian interpretation of Gaussian processes by constructing a particle approximation of the posterior of its hyperparameters using adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo. We verify and validate our approach by solving two synthetic optimization problems under uncertainty and demonstrate it by solving the oil-well-placement problem with uncertainties in the permeability field and the oil price time series.},

Our approach can be thought of as addressing the cloud-in-cloud problem for peaks and/or modifying the excursion set approach so that it averages over a special subset, rather than all possible walks. In this respect, it seeks to account for correlations between steps in the walk as well as correlations between walks. We first show how the excursion set and peaks models can be written in the same formalism, and then use this correspondence to write our combined excursion set peaks model. We then give simple expressions for the mass function and bias, showing that even the linear halo bias factor is predicted to be k-dependent as a consequence of the non-locality associated with the peak constraint. At large masses, our model has little or no need to rescale the variable {$\delta$}c from the value associated with spherical collapse, and suggests a simple explanation for why the linear halo bias factor appears to lie above that based on the peak-background split at high masses when such a rescaling is assumed. Although we have concentrated on peaks, our analysis is more generally applicable to other traditionally single-scale analyses of large-scale structure.},

Recent work has shown how to interpret such real-space measurements in terms of k-dependent bias in Fourier space, and how to remove the k-dependence to reconstruct the k-independent peak-background split halo bias parameters. We compare our reconstruction of the linear bias, which requires no free parameters, with previous estimates from N-body simulations which were obtained directly in Fourier space at large scales, and find very good agreement. Our reconstruction of the quadratic bias is similarly parameter-free, although in this case there are no previous Fourier space measurements to compare with. Our analysis of N-body simulations explicitly tests the predictions of the excursion set peaks (ESP) formalism of Paranjape et al. for the scale dependence of bias; we find that the ESP predictions accurately describe our measurements.

These extensions include: a halo mass definition which uses the TopHat filter in real space; the mean dependence of the critical density for collapse {$\delta$}c on halo mass m; and the scatter around this mean value. All three of these are motivated by the physics of triaxial rather than spherical collapse. A comparison of the resulting mass function with N-body results shows that, if one uses {$\delta$}c(m) and its scatter as determined from simulations, then all three are necessary ingredients for obtaining \texttildelow 10 per cent accuracy. For example, assuming a constant value of {$\delta$}c with no scatter, as motivated by the physics of spherical collapse, leads to many more massive haloes than seen in simulations. The same model is also in excellent agreement with N-body results for the linear halo bias, especially at the high mass end where the traditional peak-background split argument applied to the mass function fit is known to underpredict the measured bias by \texttildelow 10 per cent. In the excursion set language, our model is about walks centred on special positions (peaks) in the initial conditions - we discuss what it implies for the usual calculation in which all walks contribute to the statistics.},

We study the widely used N-body simulation fit of Tinker et al. (T08) and, as an alternative, the recently proposed analytical model of excursion set peaks (ESP). We first assess the relative bias between these prescriptions when constraining {$\sigma$}8 by sampling the ESP mass function to generate mock catalogs and using the T08 fit to analyze them, for various choices of survey selection threshold, mass definition and statistical priors. To assess the level of absolute bias in each prescription, we then repeat the analysis on dark matter halo catalogs in N-body simulations designed to mimic the mass distribution in the current data release of Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich clusters. This N-body analysis shows that using the T08 fit without accounting for the scatter introduced when converting between mass definitions (alternatively, the scatter induced by errors on the parameters of the fit) can systematically overestimate the value of {$\sigma$}8 by as much as 2{$\sigma$} for current data, while analyses that account for this scatter should be close to unbiased in {$\sigma$}8. With an increased number of objects as expected in upcoming data releases, regardless of accounting for scatter, the T08 fit could overestimate the value of {$\sigma$}8 by \texttildelow 1.5{$\sigma$}. The ESP mass function leads to systematically more biased but comparable results. A strength of the ESP model is its natural prediction of a weak nonuniversality in the mass function which closely tracks the one measured in simulations and described by the T08 fit. We suggest that it might now be prudent to build new unbiased ESP-based fitting functions for use with the larger data sets of the near future.},

Parameter inference from upcoming 21-cm observations promises to revolutionize our understanding of these unseen galaxies. However, prior inference was done using models with several simplifying assumptions. Here we introduce a flexible, physically-motivated parametrization for high-\$z\$ galaxy properties, implementing it in the public code 21cmFAST. In particular, we allow their star formation rates and ionizing escape fraction to scale with the masses of their host dark matter halos, and directly compute inhomogeneous, sub-grid recombinations in the intergalactic medium. Combining current Hubble observations of the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UV LFs) at high-\$z\$ with a mock 1000h 21-cm observation using the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA), we constrain the parameters of our model using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler of 3D simulations, 21CMMC. We show that the amplitude and scaling of the stellar mass with halo mass is strongly constrained by LF observations, while the remaining galaxy properties are constrained mainly by 21-cm observations. The two data sets compliment each other quite well, mitigating degeneracies intrinsic to each observation. All eight of our astrophysical parameters are able to be constrained at the level of \$\textbackslash sim 10\textbackslash\%\$ or better.

We perform full analyses of different cosmological models using the WiggleZ power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and 0.78, combined with other cosmological data sets. The limiting factor in this analysis is the theoretical modeling of the galaxy power spectrum, including nonlinearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. In this paper we assess several different methods for modeling the theoretical power spectrum, testing them against the Gigaparsec WiggleZ simulations (GiggleZ). We fit for a base set of six cosmological parameters, \{Omegabh2,OmegaCDMh2,H0,tau,As,ns\}, and five supplementary parameters \{nrun,r,w,Omegak,{$\sum$}mnu\}. In combination with the cosmic microwave background, our results are consistent with the LambdaCDM concordance cosmology, with a measurement of the matter density of Omegam=0.29{$\pm$}0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations sigma8=0.825{$\pm$}0.017. Using WiggleZ data with cosmic microwave background and other distance and matter power spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parameters being inconsistent with their LambdaCDM model values.

From these activities we report on system performance, including primary beam model verification, dependence of system gain on ambient temperature, measurements of receiver and overall system temperatures, and characterization of the RFI environment at each deployment site. We present an all-sky map synthesized between 139 MHz and 174 MHz using data from both arrays that reaches down to 80 mJy (4.9 K, for a beam size of 2.15e-5 steradians at 154 MHz), with a 10 mJy (620 mK) thermal noise level that indicates what would be achievable with better foreground subtraction. We calculate angular power spectra (\$C\_\textbackslash ell\$) in a cold patch and determine them to be dominated by point sources, but with contributions from galactic synchrotron emission at lower radio frequencies and angular wavemodes. Although the cosmic variance of foregrounds dominates errors in these power spectra, we measure a thermal noise level of 310 mK at \$\textbackslash ell=100\$ for a 1.46-MHz band centered at 164.5 MHz.

  abstract = {A critical challenge in measuring the power spectrum of 21 cm emission from cosmic reionization is compensating for the frequency dependence of an interferometer's sampling pattern, which can cause smooth-spectrum foregrounds to appear unsmooth and degrade the separation between foregrounds and the target signal. In this paper, we present an approach to foreground removal that explicitly accounts for this frequency dependence. We apply the delay transformation introduced in Parsons \& Backer to each baseline of an interferometer to concentrate smooth-spectrum foregrounds within the bounds of the maximum geometric delays physically realizable on that baseline. By focusing on delay modes that correspond to image-domain regions beyond the horizon, we show that it is possible to avoid the bulk of smooth-spectrum foregrounds. We map the point-spread function of delay modes to k -space, showing that delay modes that are uncorrupted by foregrounds also represent samples of the three-dimensional power spectrum, and can be used to constrain cosmic reionization. Because it uses only spectral smoothness to differentiate foregrounds from the targeted 21 cm signature, this per-baseline analysis approach relies on spectrally and spatially smooth instrumental responses for foreground removal. For sufficient levels of instrumental smoothness relative to the brightness of interfering foregrounds, this technique substantially reduces the level of calibration previously thought necessary to detect 21 cm reionization. As a result, this approach places fewer constraints on antenna configuration within an array, and in particular, facilitates the adoption of configurations that are optimized for power-spectrum sensitivity. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the potential for the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) to detect 21 cm reionization at an amplitude of 10 mK 2 near k 0.2 h Mpc \textendash 1 with 132 dipoles in 7 months of observing.},

It is unclear what the optimal design is for achieving both of these goals. Via a pedagogical derivation of an interferometer's response to the power spectrum of 21 cm reionization fluctuations, we show that even under optimistic scenarios first-generation arrays will yield low-signal-to-noise detections, and that different compact array configurations can substantially alter sensitivity. We explore the sensitivity gains of array configurations that yield high redundancy in the uv -plane\textemdash configurations that have been largely ignored since the advent of self-calibration for high-dynamic-range imaging. We first introduce a mathematical framework to generate optimal minimum-redundancy configurations for imaging. We contrast the sensitivity of such configurations with high-redundancy configurations, finding that high-redundancy configurations can improve power-spectrum sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude. We explore how high-redundancy array configurations can be tuned to various angular scales, enabling array sensitivity to be directed away from regions of the uv -plane (such as the origin) where foregrounds are brighter and instrumental systematics are more problematic. We demonstrate that a 132 antenna deployment of the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization observing for 120 days in a high-redundancy configuration will, under ideal conditions, have the requisite sensitivity to detect the power spectrum of the 21 cm signal from reionization at a 3{$\sigma$} level at k {$<$} 0.25 h Mpc \textendash 1 in a bin of {$\Delta$}ln k = 1.

Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization in South Africa. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of the delay-spectrum approach to avoiding foregrounds, achieving over eight orders of magnitude of foreground suppression (in mK2). Combining this approach with a procedure for removing off-diagonal covariances arising from instrumental systematics, we achieve a best 2{$\sigma$} upper limit of (41 mK)2 for k = 0.27 h Mpc-1 at z = 7.7. This limit falls within an order of magnitude of the brighter predictions of the expected 21 cm EoR signal level. Using the upper limits set by these measurements, we generate new constraints on the brightness temperature of 21 cm emission in neutral regions for various reionization models. We show that for several ionization scenarios, our measurements are inconsistent with cold reionization. That is, heating of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) is necessary to remain consistent with the constraints we report. Hence, we have suggestive evidence that by z = 7.7, the H I has been warmed from its cold primordial state, probably by X-rays from high-mass X-ray binaries or miniquasars. The strength of this evidence depends on the ionization state of the IGM, which we are not yet able to constrain. This result is consistent with standard predictions for how reionization might have proceeded.},

  abstract = {The redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). However, its detection requires a thorough understanding and control of the systematic errors. We study two systematic biases observed in the LOFAR EoR residual data after calibration and subtraction of bright discrete foreground sources. The first effect is a suppression in the diffuse foregrounds, which could potentially mean a suppression of the 21 cm signal. The second effect is an excess of noise beyond the thermal noise. The excess noise shows fluctuations on small frequency scales, and hence it can not be easily removed by foreground removal or avoidance methods. Our analysis suggests that sidelobes of residual sources due to the chromatic point spread function and ionospheric scintillation can not be the dominant causes of the excess noise. Rather, both the suppression of diffuse foregrounds and the excess noise can occur due to calibration with an incomplete sky model containing predominantly bright discrete sources. We show that calibrating only on bright sources can cause suppression of other signals and introduce an excess noise in the data. The levels of the suppression and excess noise depend on the relative flux of sources which are not included in the model with respect to the flux of modeled sources. We discuss possible solutions such as using only long baselines to calibrate the interferometric gain solutions as well as simultaneous multi-frequency calibration along with their benefits and shortcomings.},

  abstract = {Modelling the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) in dark matter halos is important for studying galaxy evolution in the cosmological context. We compute the abundance and clustering properties of HI-selected galaxies using halo models constrained by data from the ALFALFA survey. We apply an MCMC-based statistical analysis to constrain the model parameters through two different approaches. In the first approach, we describe the HI content of galaxies in dark matter halos directly, using a halo occupation distribution (HOD) for the number counts of HI galaxies. We find that a significant number of low mass (\$m\_\{\textbackslash rm HI\} \textbackslash lesssim 10\^\{9.5\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) galaxies must be satellites. In the second, more novel approach, we infer the HI-dark matter connection at the massive end (\$m\_\{\textbackslash rm HI\} {$>$} 10\^\{9.5\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) \$\textbackslash textit\{indirectly\}\$, using optical properties of low-redshift galaxies as an intermediary. In particular, we use a previously calibrated optical HOD describing the luminosity- and colour-dependent clustering of SDSS galaxies and describe the HI content using a statistical scaling relation between the optical properties and HI mass. The resulting best-fit scaling relation identifies massive HI galaxies primarily with optically faint blue centrals, consistent with expectations from galaxy formation models. Our results will be useful in making forecasts for future observations of HI galaxies with upcoming radio telescopes like the SKA, as well as in exploring synergies between SKA and optical surveys such as Euclid and LSST.},

We investigate the dependence of the halo shape on characteristics such as mass and number of members. In the three-dimensional case, we find a significant correlation between the mass and the halo shape; massive systems are more prolate than small haloes. We detect a source of strong systematics in estimates of the triaxiality of a halo, which is found to be a strong function of the number of members; Lambda cold dark matter haloes usually characterized by triaxial shapes, slightly bent towards prolate forms, appear more oblate when taking only a small subset of the halo particles.  The ellipticities of observed 2PIGG and SDSS-DR3GC groups are found to be strongly dependent on the number of group members, so that poor groups appear more elongated than rich ones. However, this is again an artefact caused by poor statistics and not an intrinsic property of the galaxy groups, nor an effect from observational biases. We interpret these results with the aid of a GALFORM (Cole et al.) mock 2PIGG catalogue. When comparing the group ellipticities in mock and real catalogues, we find an excellent agreement between the trends of shapes with number of group members. When carefully taking into account the effects of low-number statistics, we find that more massive groups are consistent with more elongated shapes. Finally, our studies find no significant correlations between the shapes of observed 2PIGG or SDSS-DR3GC groups with the properties of galaxy members such as colour- or spectral-type index.},

  abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We first show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. The quasi-linear mass correlations are in fact reproduced well by a model of independent randomly-placed haloes. The distribution of galaxies within the halo density field depends on: (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number - the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. This second assumption is essential if small-scale galaxy correlations are to remain close to a single power law, rather than flattening in the same way as the correlations of the overall density field. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat {$\Omega$}=0.3 model ({$\Lambda$}CDM), but not for an {$\Omega$}=1 model with the same power spectrum ({$\tau$}CDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high {$\Omega$}, and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the {$\Lambda$}CDM model is lower than that of the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

This calculation is revisited, without making the assumption that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature is known, and considering in detail the possibility of a recollapsing universe. New accurate approximations for the growth of perturbations and the mass function of dark haloes are presented. Structure forms readily in the recollapsing phase of a model with negative {$\Lambda$}, so collapse fraction alone cannot forbid {$\Lambda$} from being large and negative. A negative {$\Lambda$} is disfavoured only if we assume that formation of observers can be neglected once the recollapsing universe has heated to T {$>\sptilde$} 8 K. For the case of positive {$\Lambda$}, however, the current universe does occupy an extremely typical position compared to the predicted distribution on the {$\Lambda$} - T plane. Contrasting conclusions can be reached if anthropic arguments are applied to the curvature of the universe, and we discuss the falsifiability of this mode of anthropic reasoning.},

The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Cal\'an/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8{$\Omega$}M-0.6{$\Omega\Lambda\sptilde$}-0.2+/-0.1 in the region of interest ({$\Omega$}M{$<\sptilde$}1.5). For a flat ({$\Omega$}M+{$\Omega\Lambda$}=1) cosmology we find {$\Omega$}flatM=0.28+0.09-0.08 (1 {$\sigma$} statistical) +0.05-0.04 (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a {$\Lambda$}=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, {$\Lambda$}=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P({$\Lambda>$}0)=99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is tflat0=14.9+1.4-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Cal\'an/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

Work in the past has used this effect to rule out velocity-independent, elastic cross sections larger than sigma/m \textasciitilde{} 0.02 cm\^2/g based on comparisons to the shapes of galaxy cluster lensing potentials and X-ray isophotes. In this paper, we use cosmological simulations to show that these constraints were off by more than an order of magnitude because (a) they did not properly account for the fact that the observed ellipticity gets contributions from the triaxial mass distribution outside the core set by scatterings, (b) the scatter in axis ratios is large and (c) the core region retains more of its triaxial nature than estimated before. Including these effects properly shows that the same observations now allow dark matter self-interaction cross sections at least as large as sigma/m = 0.1 cm\^2/g. We show that constraints on self-interacting dark matter from strong-lensing clusters are likely to improve significantly in the near future, but possibly more via central densities and core sizes than halo shapes.},

  abstract = {The fraction of galaxies with red colours depends sensitively on environment, and on the way in which environment is measured. To distinguish competing theories for the quenching of star formation, a robust and complete description of environment is required, to be applied to a large sample of galaxies. The environment of galaxies can be described using the density field of neighbours on multiple scales - the multiscale density field. We are using the Millennium simulation and a simple halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescription which describes the multiscale density field of Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 galaxies to investigate the dependence of the fraction of red galaxies on the environment. Using a volume-limited sample, where we have sufficient galaxies in narrow density bins, we have more dynamic range in halo mass and density for satellite galaxies than for central galaxies. Therefore, we model the red fraction of central galaxies as a constant while we use a functional form to describe the red fraction of satellites as a function of halo mass which allows us to distinguish a sharp from a gradual transition. While it is clear that the data can only be explained by a gradual transition, an analysis of the multiscale density field on different scales suggests that colour segregation within the haloes is needed to explain the results. We also rule out a sharp transition for central galaxies, within the halo mass range sampled.},

  abstract = {We perform a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of cosmological structure formation starting from Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions. We adopt the best-fitting cosmological parameters of WMAP (3rd- and 5th-year) and we consider non-Gaussianity of the local type parameterised by 8 different values of the non-linearity parameter F\_NL. Building upon previous work based on the Gaussian case, we show that, expressed in terms of suitable variables, the mass function of friends-of-friends haloes is approximately universal (i.e. independent of redshift, cosmology, and matter transfer function) to good precision (nearly 10 per cent) also in non-Gaussian scenarios. We provide fitting formulae for the high-mass end (M{$>$}10\^13 M\_sol/h) of the universal mass function in terms of F\_NL, and we also present a non-universal fit in terms of both F\_NL and z to be used for applications requiring higher accuracy. In the Gaussian case, we extend our fit to a wider range of halo masses (M{$>$}2.4 x 10\^10 M\_sol/h) and we also provide a consistent fit of the linear halo bias. We show that, for realistic values of F\_NL, the matter power-spectrum in non-Gaussian cosmologies departs from the Gaussian one by up to 2 per cent on the scales where the baryonic- oscillation features are imprinted on the 2-point statistics. We confirm the strong k-dependence of the halo bias on large scales (k{$<$}0.05 h Mpc\^-1) which was already detected in previous studies. However, we find that commonly used parameterisations based on the peak-background split do not provide an accurate description of our simulations which present extra dependencies on the wavenumber, the non-linearity parameter and, possibly, the clustering strength. We provide an accurate fit of the simulation data that can be used as a benchmark for future determinations of F\_NL with galaxy surveys.},

  abstract = {Starting in late 2013, the eRosita telescope will survey the X-ray sky with unprecedented sensitivity. Assuming a detection limit of 50 photons in the (0.5-2.0) keV energy band with a typical exposure time of 1.6 ks, we predict that eRosita will detect \texttildelow 9.3 \texttimes{} 104 clusters of galaxies more massive than 5 \texttimes{} 1013 h-1 M{$\odot$}, with the currently planned all-sky survey. Their median redshift will be z{$\simeq$} 0.35. We perform a Fisher-matrix analysis to forecast the constraining power of ? on the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmology and, simultaneously, on the X-ray scaling relations for galaxy clusters. Special attention is devoted to the possibility of detecting primordial non-Gaussianity. We consider two experimental probes: the number counts and the angular clustering of a photon-count limited sample of clusters. We discuss how the cluster sample should be split to optimize the analysis and we show that redshift information of the individual clusters is vital to break the strong degeneracies among the model parameters. For example, performing a 'tomographic' analysis based on photometric-redshift estimates and combining one- and two-point statistics will give marginal 1{$\sigma$} errors of {$\Delta\sigma$}8{$\simeq$} 0.036 and {$\Delta\Omega$}m{$\simeq$} 0.012 without priors, and improve the current estimates on the slope of the luminosity-mass relation by a factor of 3. Regarding primordial non-Gaussianity, ? clusters alone will give {$\Delta$}fNL{$\simeq$} 9, 36 and 144 for the local, orthogonal and equilateral model, respectively. Measuring redshifts with spectroscopic accuracy would further tighten the constraints by nearly 40 per cent (barring fNL which displays smaller improvements). Finally, combining ? data with the analysis of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background by the Planck satellite should give sensational constraints on both the cosmology and the properties of the intracluster medium.},

The frequency dependence of the synthesized beam implies that the sidelobes of these sources will move across the field of view as a function of observing frequency, hence frustrating line-of-sight foreground subtraction techniques. We describe a method for subtracting these point sources from dirty maps produced by an instrument such as the MWA. This technique combines matched filters with an iterative centroiding scheme to locate and characterize point sources in the presence of a diffuse background. Simulations show that this technique can improve the dynamic range of epoch-of-reionization maps by 2-3 orders of magnitude.},

The catalogue contains 1227 entries, making it over six times the size of the Planck Early SZ (ESZ) sample and the largest SZ-selected catalogue to date. It contains 861 confirmed clusters, of which 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-up observations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters. The remaining 366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into three classes according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be true clusters. The Planck SZ catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue, with redshifts up to about one, and spans the broadest cluster mass range from (0.1 to 1.6) \texttimes{} 1015 M{$\odot$}. Confirmation of cluster candidates through comparison with existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is the statistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness and statistical reliability. The outputs of the validation process are provided as additional information. This gives, in particular, an ensemble of 813 cluster redshifts, and for all these Planck clusters we also include a mass estimated from a newly-proposed SZ-mass proxy. A refined measure of the SZ Compton parameter for the clusters with X-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an X-ray flux for all the Planck clusters not previously detected in X-ray surveys.

  abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega\{\_\}m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95\{\%\} upper limit of r\{{$<\rbrace$}0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N\{\_\}eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N\{\_\}eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data. [Abridged]\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {We present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from the Planck full mission data set. Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal down to a signal-to-noise ratio of 6, and is more than a factor of 2 larger than the 2013 Planck cluster cosmology sample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible constraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the larger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in redshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of gravitational lensing of background galaxies by Planck clusters to provide priors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, (1-b). In addition, we use lensing of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by Planck clusters as an independent constraint on this parameter. These various calibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those from the Planck analysis of primary fluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of (1-b) the tension is mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while it remains substantial (3.7{$\sigma$}) for the largest estimated value. We also examine constraints on extensions to the base flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model by combining the cluster and CMB constraints. The combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses, but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because it simultaneously lowers the implied value of the Hubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10\%-level to 1\% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide a stringent test of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM model.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {This work describes a new instrument optimized for a detection of the  neutral hydrogen 21 cm power spectrum between redshifts of 0.5 and 1.5: the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Broadband and Broad-beam (BAOBAB) array. BAOBAB will build on the efforts of a first generation of 21 cm experiments that are targeting a detection of the signal from the Epoch of Reionization at z \textasciitilde{} 10. At z \textasciitilde{} 1, the emission from neutral hydrogen in self-shielded overdense halos also presents an accessible signal, since the dominant, synchrotron foreground emission is considerably fainter than at redshift 10. The principle science driver for these observations are baryon acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum which have the potential to act as a standard ruler and constrain the nature of dark energy. BAOBAB will fully correlate dual-polarization antenna tiles over the 600-900 MHz band with a frequency resolution of 300 kHz and a system temperature of 50 K. The number of antennas will grow in staged deployments, and reconfigurations of the array will allow for both traditional imaging and high power spectrum sensitivity operations. We present calculations of the power spectrum sensitivity for various array sizes, with a 35 element array measuring the cosmic neutral hydrogen fraction as a function of redshift, and a 132 element system detecting the BAO features in the power spectrum, yielding a 1.8\% error on the z \textasciitilde{} 1 distance scale, and, in turn, significant improvements to constraints on the dark energy equation of state over an unprecedented range of redshifts from \textasciitilde 0.5 to 1.5.},

  abstract = {A number of experiments are currently working toward a measurement of  the 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whether or not these experiments deliver a detection of cosmological emission, their limited sensitivity will prevent them from providing detailed information about the astrophysics of reionization. In this work, we consider what types of measurements will be enabled by the next generation of larger 21 cm EoR telescopes. To calculate the type of constraints that will be possible with such arrays, we use simple models for the instrument, foreground emission, and the reionization history. We focus primarily on an instrument modeled after the \textasciitilde 0.1 km2 collecting area Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array concept design and parameterize the uncertainties with regard to foreground emission by considering different limits to the recently described "wedge" footprint in k space. Uncertainties in the reionization history are accounted for using a series of simulations that vary the ionizing efficiency and minimum virial temperature of the galaxies responsible for reionization, as well as the mean free path of ionizing photons through the intergalactic medium. Given various combinations of models, we consider the significance of the possible power spectrum detections, the ability to trace the power spectrum evolution versus redshift, the detectability of salient power spectrum features, and the achievable level of quantitative constraints on astrophysical parameters. Ultimately, we find that 0.1 km2 of collecting area is enough to ensure a very high significance (gsim 30{$\sigma$}) detection of the reionization power spectrum in even the most pessimistic scenarios. This sensitivity should allow for meaningful constraints on the reionization history and astrophysical parameters, especially if foreground subtraction techniques can be improved and successfully implemented.},

To date, most work has focused on recovering the spherically averaged power spectrum of the 21-cm signal, since this approach maximizes the signal to noise in the initial measurement. However, like galaxy surveys, the 21-cm signal is affected by redshift space distortions, and is inherently anisotropic between the line of sight and transverse directions. A measurement of this anisotropy can yield unique cosmological information, potentially even isolating the matter power spectrum from astrophysical effects. However, in interferometric measurements, foregrounds also have an anisotropic footprint between the line of sight and transverse directions: the so-called foreground `wedge'. Although foreground subtraction techniques are actively being developed, a `foreground avoidance' approach of simply ignoring contaminated modes has arguably proven most successful to date. In this work, we analyse the effect of this foreground anisotropy in recovering the redshift space distortion signature in 21-cm measurements at both high and intermediate redshifts. We find the foreground wedge corrupts nearly all of the redshift space signal for even the largest proposed EoR experiments (Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array), making cosmological information unrecoverable without foreground subtraction. The situation is somewhat improved at lower redshifts, where the redshift-dependent mapping from observed coordinates to cosmological coordinates significantly reduces the size of the wedge. Using only foreground avoidance, we find that a large experiment like Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment can place non-trivial constraints on cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {We present the Gigaparsec WiggleZ simulation suite and use this resource to characterize galaxy bias and its scale dependence for a range of redshifts and halo masses in a standard {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmology. Under the ansatz that bias converges to a scale-independent form at large scales, we develop an eight-parameter phenomenological model which fully expresses the mass and redshift dependence of bias and its scale dependence in real- or redshift space. This is then used to illustrate how scale-dependent bias can systematically skew measurements of the growth rate of cosmic structure obtained from redshift-space distortion measurements. When data is fit only to scales kmax {$\leq$} 0.1 [h- 1 Mpc]- 1, we find that these effects are significant only for large biases (b {$\greaterequivlnt$} 3) at large redshifts (z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1). However, when smaller scales are incorporated (kmax {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.2 [h- 1 Mpc]- 1) to increase measurement precision, the combination of reduced statistical uncertainties and increased scale-dependent bias can result in highly significant systematics for most large haloes across all redshifts. We identify several new interesting aspects of bias, including a significant large-scale bias boost for small haloes at low redshifts due to substructure effects (\texttildelow 20 per cent for Milky Way-like systems) and a nearly redshift-independent halo mass (corresponding to a redshift-space bias of \texttildelow 1.5) for which halo bias has little or no scale dependence on scales greater than 3 [h-1Mpc]. This suggests an optimal strategy of targeting bias \texttildelow 1.5 systems for clustering studies which are dominated more by systematic uncertainties in how observed halo (or galaxy) distributions map to their underlying mass distribution than by observational statistical precision, such as cosmological measurements of neutrino masses.

We report on results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art, multi-stepping, parallel N-body codes: PKDGRAV and GADGET. We find that convergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of the gravitational softening, time-step, force accuracy, initial redshift, and particle number. For softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effects are negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii where the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the time-step is much shorter than the local orbital time-scale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristic acceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enough particles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation time-scale is longer than the age of the Universe. Convergence also requires sufficiently high initial redshift and accurate force computations. Poor spatial, time, or force resolution leads generally to systems with artificially low central density, but may also result in the formation of artificially dense central cusps. We have explored several adaptive time-stepping choices and we have obtained the best results when individual time-steps are chosen according to the local acceleration and the gravitational softening ({$\Delta$}ti\textasciitilde{} ({$\varepsilon$}/ai)1/2), although further experimentation may yield better and more efficient criteria. The most stringent requirement for convergence is typically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxation criterion. This implies that, in order to estimate accurate circular velocities at radii where the density contrast may reach \textasciitilde 106, the region must enclose of the order of 3000 particles (or more than a few times 106 within the virial radius). Applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized {$\Lambda$}CDM halo, we find that the spherically averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slope shallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, \textasciitilde 0.005 r200, with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the inner regions.},

  abstract = {We investigate the impact finite simulation box size has on the structural and kinematic properties of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes forming in cosmological simulations. Our approach involves generating a single realization of the initial power spectrum of density perturbations and studying how truncation of this power spectrum on scales larger than Lcut = 2{$\pi$}/kcut affects the structure of dark matter haloes at z = 0. In particular, we have examined the cases of Lcut = fcut Lbox with fcut = 1 (i.e. no truncation), 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4. In common with previous studies, we find that the suppression of long wavelength perturbations reduces the strength of clustering, as measured by a suppression of the two-point correlation function {$\xi$}(r), and reduces the numbers of the most massive haloes, as reflected in the depletion of the high-mass end of the mass function n(M). However, we note that the number density of `intermediate'-mass haloes (M \textasciitilde{} 1013h-1Msolar) is enhanced by the suppression of long wavelength perturbations - by as much as \textasciitilde 20 per cent for fcut = 1/4 - and that this effect becomes more pronounced as fcut is decreased. Such a trend is in good agreement with the predictions of the Sheth-Tormen prescription. Interestingly, we find that truncation of the initial power spectrum has little impact on the internal properties of haloes. The masses of high-mass haloes decrease in a systematic manner as Lcut is reduced, but the distribution of concentrations is unaffected. On the other hand, the median spin parameter is \textasciitilde 15 per cent lower in runs with fcut {$<$} 1. We argue that this is an imprint of the linear growth phase of the halo's angular momentum by tidal torquing, and that the absence of any measurable trend in concentration or halo shape reflects the importance of virialization and complex mass-accretion histories for these quantities. These results are of interest for studies that require high-mass resolution and statistical samples of simulated haloes, such as simulations of the population of first stars. Our analysis shows that large-scale tidal fields have relatively little effect on the internal properties of CDM haloes and hence may be ignored in these studies.},

We address this question using cosmological N-body simulations to examine how properties of low-mass haloes that are potentially accessible to observation, such as their spatial clustering, rate of accretions and mergers onto massive galaxies, and the angular momentum content of massive galaxies, differ between a fiducial {$\Lambda$}CDM model and dark matter models in which low-mass halo formation is suppressed. Adopting an effective cut-off mass scale M cut below which small-scale power is suppressed in the initial conditions, we study dark matter models in which M cut varies between 5\texttimes 109 h -1M{$\odot$} and 1011 h -1M{$\odot$}, equivalent to the host haloes of dwarf and low-mass galaxies. Our results show that both the clustering strength of low-mass haloes around galaxy-mass primaries and the rate at which they merge with these primaries are sensitive to the assumed value of M cut; in contrast, suppressing low-mass halo formation has little influence on the angular momentum content of galaxy-mass haloes-it is the quiescence or violence of a halo's assembly history that has a more marked effect. However, we expect that measuring the effect on spatial clustering or the merger rate is likely to be observationally difficult for realistic values of M cut, and so isolating the effect of this small-scale structure would appear to be remarkably difficult to detect, at least in the present day Universe.},

We find that isolated halos in this mass range extend well beyond Rvir exhibiting all properties of virialized objects up to 2Rvir-3Rvir: relatively smooth density profiles and no systematic infall velocities. The dark matter halos in this mass range do not grow as one naively may expect through a steady accretion of satellites; i.e., on average there is no mass infall. This is strikingly different from more massive halos, which have large infall velocities outside the virial radius. We provide an accurate fit for the density profile of these isolated galaxy-size halos. For a wide range 0.01Rvir-2Rvir of radii the halo density profiles are fitted with the approximation {$\rho$}={$\rho$}sexp[-2n(x1/n-1)+{$<\rho$}m{$>$}, where x{$\equiv$}r/rs, {$<\rho$}m{$>$} is the mean matter density of the universe, and the index n is in the range n=6-7.5. These profiles do not show a sudden change of behavior beyond the virial radius. For larger radii we combine the statistics of the initial fluctuations with the spherical collapse model to obtain predictions for the mean and most probable density profiles for halos of several masses. The model gives excellent results beyond 2-3 formal virial radii for the most probable profile and qualitatively correct predictions for the mean profile.},

The results presented in this paper are based on four large N-body simulations with \texttildelow 10 billion particles each: the Millennium-I and -II, Bolshoi and MultiDark simulations. The MultiDark (or BigBolshoi) simulation is introduced in this paper. This suite of simulations with high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute with unprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (about six orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state of the art of our current knowledge on this basic property of dark matter haloes in the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. We find that there is consistency among the different simulation data sets, despite the different codes, numerical algorithms and halo/subhalo finders used in our analysis. We confirm a novel feature for halo concentrations at high redshifts: a flattening and upturn with increasing mass. The concentration c(M, z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological parameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms of the linear rms fluctuation of the density field {$\sigma$}(M, z), the halo concentration c({$\sigma$}) shows a nearly universal simple U-shaped behaviour with a minimum at a well-defined scale at {$\sigma$}\texttildelow{} 0.71. Yet, some small dependences with redshift and cosmology still remain. At the high-mass end ({$\sigma$} {$<$} 1), the median halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highly radial orbits. This c-{$\sigma$}(M, z) relation can be accurately parametrized and provides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass. When applied to galaxy clusters, our estimates of concentrations are substantially larger - by a factor up to 1.5 - than previous results from smaller simulations, and are in much better agreement with results of observations.},

  abstract = {A measurement of the cosmological 21 \{cm\} signal remains a promising but as-of-yet unattained ambition of radio astronomy. A positive detection would provide direct observations of key unexplored epochs of our cosmic history, including the cosmic dark ages and reionization. In this paper, we concentrate on measurements of the spatial monopole of the 21 \{cm\} brightness temperature as a function of redshift (the ``global signal''). Most global experiments to date have been single-element experiments. In this paper, we show how an interferometer can be designed to be sensitive to the monopole mode of the sky, thus providing an alternate approach to accessing the global signature. We provide simple rules of thumb for designing a global signal interferometer and use numerical simulations to show that a modest array of tightly packed antenna elements with moderately sized primary beams (FWHM of {$\sim$} 40\^\textbackslash circ ) can compete with typical single-element experiments in their ability to constrain phenomenological parameters pertaining to reionization and the pre-reionization era. We also provide a general data analysis framework for extracting the global signal from interferometric measurements (with analysis of single-element experiments arising as a special case) and discuss trade-offs with various data analysis choices. Given that interferometric measurements are able to avoid a number of systematics inherent in single-element experiments, our results suggest that interferometry ought to be explored as a complementary way to probe the global signal.},

This will allow both imaging and statistical maps of the 21cm signal at redshifts z = 6 - 27 and constrain the underlying cosmology and evolution of the density field. This era includes nearly 60\% of the (in principle) observable volume of the Universe and many more linear modes than the CMB, presenting an opportunity for SKA to usher in a new level of precision cosmology. This optimistic picture is complicated by the need to understand and remove the effect of astrophysics, so that systematics rather than statistics will limit constraints. This chapter describes the cosmological, as opposed to astrophysical, information available to SKA. Key areas for discussion include: cosmological parameters constraints using 21cm fluctuations as a tracer of the density field; lensing of the 21cm signal, constraints on heating via exotic physics such as decaying or annihilating dark matter; impact of fundamental physics such as non-Gaussianity or warm dark matter on the source population; and constraints on the bulk flows arising from the decoupling of baryons and photons at z = 1000. The chapter explores the path to separating cosmology from astrophysics, for example via velocity space distortions and separation in redshift. We discuss new opportunities for extracting cosmology made possible by the sensitivity of SKA Phase 1 and explores the advances achievable with SKA2.},

In this paper we develop a model for the compact foreground sources in one of the target fields of the MWA's EoR key science experiment: the `EoR1' field. The model is based on both the MWA's GLEAM survey and GMRT 150 MHz data from the TGSS survey, the latter providing higher angular resolution and better astrometric accuracy for compact sources than is available from the MWA alone. The model contains 5049 sources, some of which have complicated morphology in MWA data, Fornax A being the most complex. The higher resolution data show that 13\% of sources that appear point-like to the MWA have complicated morphology such as double and quad structure, with a typical separation of 33\textasciitilde arcsec. We derive an analytic expression for the error introduced into the EoR two-dimensional power spectrum due to peeling close double sources as single point sources and show that for the measured source properties, the error in the power spectrum is confined to high \$k\_\textbackslash bot\$ modes that do not affect the overall result for the large-scale cosmological signal of interest. The brightest ten mis-modelled sources in the field contribute 90\% of the power bias in the data, suggesting that it is most critical to improve the models of the brightest sources. With this hybrid model we reprocess data from the EoR1 field and show a maximum of 8\% improved calibration accuracy and a factor of two reduction in residual power in \$k\$-space from peeling these sources. Implications for future EoR experiments including the SKA are discussed in relation to the improvements obtained.},

More massive haloes have a higher clustering because they live in denser regions, while low mass haloes can be found in a wide range of environments, and hence they have a lower clustering. Using a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) test, we can predict b(m) from b(d), but we cannot predict b(d) from b(m), which shows that environment is more fundamental for bias than mass. This has implications for the HOD model interpretation of the galaxy clustering, since when a galaxy selection is affected by environment, the standard HOD implementation fails. We show that the effects of environment are very important for colour selected samples in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. In these cases, bias can be better recovered if we use environmental density instead of mass as the HOD variable. This can be readily applied to observations as the background density of galaxies is shown to be a very good proxy of environment.},

We introduce a new leapfrog integrator that allows for variable timesteps for each particle in large N-body simulations. Tests with single particles in fixed potentials show that it behaves as a symplectic integrator. We then examine the results of both standard leapfrog and our temporally adaptive leapfrog on full N-body integrations of clusters and large scale structure establishing accuracy criteria for both methods. The adaptive method shows significant speed-ups over single step integrations---but the integrator no longer appears to be symplectic or, in the case of large scale structure simulations, accurate. This loss of accuracy appears to be caused by the way that the timestep is chosen, not by the integrator itself. We present a related integration technique that does retain sufficient accuracy. Although it is not symplectic, it is apparently better than previous implementations and is our current integrator of choice for large astrophysical simulations. We also note that the standard leapfrog difference equations used in cosmological N-body integrations in comoving coordinates are not symplectic. We derive an implementation of leapfrog that is in comoving canonical coordinates to correct for this deficiency.},

  abstract = {One of the main challenges in probing the reionization epoch using the redshifted 21 cm line is that the magnitude of the signal is several orders smaller than the astrophysical foregrounds. One of the methods to deal with the problem is to avoid a wedge-shaped region in the Fourier \$k\_\{\textbackslash perp\} - k\_\{\textbackslash parallel\}\$ space which contains the signal from the spectrally smooth foregrounds. However, measuring the spherically averaged power spectrum using only modes outside this wedge (i.e., in the reionization window), leads to a bias. We provide a prescription, based on expanding the power spectrum in terms of the shifted Legendre polynomials, which can be used to compute the angular moments of the power spectrum in the reionization window. The prescription requires computation of the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole moments of the power spectrum using the theoretical model under consideration and also the knowledge of the effective extent of the foreground wedge in the \$k\_\{\textbackslash perp\} - k\_\{\textbackslash parallel\}\$ plane. One can then calculate the theoretical power spectrum in the window which can be directly compared with observations. The analysis should have implications for avoiding any bias in the parameter constraints using 21 cm power spectrum data.},

  abstract = {A possible way to disentangle the redshifted 21 cm signal of neutral  hydrogen (HI) in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) from the much larger astrophysical foregrounds is to restrict the analysis to a wedge-shaped region in the Fourier space. The foregrounds are confined to this wedge because of their smooth spectral properties which allows one to estimate the HI power spectrum in the foreground-free portion, known as the reionization window. The estimate of the spherically averaged power spectrum in the window, however, differs from the true value because of the line of sight anisotropies in the signal. The difference can be estimated and taken into account for a given reion- ization model by expanding the power spectrum in terms of the Legendre polynomials. This corrected power spectrum, called as the clustering wedges, can then be used for comparing the model predictions with the observations. In this work, we carefully ex- amine whether the clustering wedges are appropriate for such model comparisons and whether they provide truly unbiased constraints on the EoR parameters. We use the excursion-set based semi-numerical simulations, coupled with MCMC-based statistical methods, for our analysis. We find that the clustering wedges not only yield faithful constraints, the statistical uncertainties on the parameter values too are comparable to those obtained using the data without the presence of any foregrounds. We also find that the clustering wedges are helpful in breaking the degeneracies between different EoR model parameters.},

However, the distribution of galaxies is dependent on their formation and evolution as well as on the cosmological model, and galaxy formation is still not a well-constrained process. Thus, methods that probe cosmology using galaxies as tracers for dark matter must be able to accurately estimate the cosmological parameters. This can be done without knowing details of galaxy formation a priori as long as the galaxies are well represented by a halo occupation distribution (HOD). We apply this reasoning to the method of obtaining {$\Omega$} m  and {$\sigma$}8 from galaxy clustering combined with the mass-to-number ratio of galaxy clusters. To test the sensitivity of this method to variations due to galaxy formation, we consider several different models applied to the same cosmological dark matter simulation. The cosmological parameters are then estimated using the observables in each model, marginalizing over the parameters of the HOD. We find that for models where the galaxies can be well represented by a parameterized HOD, this method can successfully extract the desired cosmological parameters for a wide range of galaxy formation prescriptions.},

  abstract = {We use a high-resolution {$\Lambda$}CDM numerical simulation to calculate the mass function of dark matter haloes down to the scale of dwarf galaxies, back to a redshift of 15, in a 50 h-1 Mpc volume containing 80 million particles. Our low-redshift results allow us to probe low-{$\sigma$} density fluctuations significantly beyond the range of previous cosmological simulations. The Sheth \& Tormen mass function provides an excellent match to all of our data except for redshifts of 10 and higher, where it overpredicts halo numbers increasingly with redshift, reaching roughly 50 per cent for the 1010-1011 Msolar haloes sampled at redshift 15. Our results confirm previous findings that the simulated halo mass function can be described solely by the variance of the mass distribution, and thus has no explicit redshift dependence. We provide an empirical fit to our data that corrects for the overprediction of extremely rare objects by the Sheth \& Tormen mass function. This overprediction has implications for studies that use the number densities of similarly rare objects as cosmological probes. For example, the number density of high-redshift (z\textasciitilde = 6) QSOs, which are thought to be hosted by haloes at 5{$\sigma$} peaks in the fluctuation field, are likely to be overpredicted by at least a factor of 50 per cent. We test the sensitivity of our results to force accuracy, starting redshift and halo-finding algorithm.},

  abstract = {We use an array of high-resolution N-body simulations to determine the mass function of dark matter haloes at redshifts 10-30. We develop a new method for compensating for the effects of finite simulation volume that allows us to find an approximation to the true `global' mass function. By simulating a wide range of volumes at different mass resolution, we calculate the abundance of haloes of mass 105-12h-1Msolar. This enables us to predict accurately the abundance of the haloes that host the sources that reionize the Universe. In particular, we focus on the small mass haloes ({$>\sptilde$}105.5-6h-1Msolar) likely to harbour Population III stars where gas cools by molecular hydrogen emission, early galaxies in which baryons cool by atomic hydrogen emission at a virial temperature of \textasciitilde 104K (\textasciitilde 107.5-8 h-1Msolar), and massive galaxies that may be observable at redshift \textasciitilde 10. When we combine our data with simulations that include high-mass haloes at low redshift, we find that the best fit to the halo mass function depends not only on the linear overdensity, as is commonly assumed in analytic models, but also on the slope of the linear power spectrum at the scale of the halo mass. The Press-Schechter model gives a poor fit to the halo mass function in the simulations at all epochs; the Sheth-Tormen model gives a better match, but still overpredicts the abundance of rare objects at all times by up to 50 per cent. Finally, we consider the consequences of the recently released WMAP 3-yr cosmological parameters. These lead to much less structure at high redshift, reducing the number of z = 10 `mini-haloes' by more than a factor of two and the number of z = 30 galaxy hosts by nearly four orders of magnitude.

  abstract = {We present a catalog of galaxy cluster candidates, selected through their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature in the first 720 deg2 of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey. This area was mapped with the SPT in the 2008 and 2009 austral winters to a depth of \textasciitilde 18 {$\mu$}KCMB-arcmin at 150 GHz 550 deg2 of it was also mapped to \textasciitilde 44 {$\mu$}KCMB-arcmin at 95 GHz. Based on optical imaging of all 224 candidates and near-infrared imaging of the majority of candidates, we have found optical and/or infrared counterparts for 158, which we then classify as confirmed galaxy clusters. Of these 158 clusters, 135 were first identified as clusters in SPT data, including 117 new discoveries reported in this work. This catalog triples the number of confirmed galaxy clusters discovered through the SZ effect. We report photometrically derived (and in some cases spectroscopic) redshifts for confirmed clusters and redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates. The catalog extends to high redshift with a median redshift of z = 0.55 and maximum confirmed redshift of z = 1.37. Forty-five of the clusters have counterparts in the ROSAT bright or faint source catalogs from which we estimate X-ray fluxes. Based on simulations, we expect the catalog to be nearly 100\% complete above M 500 {$\approx$} 5 \texttimes{} 1014 M {$\odot$} h -1 70 at z {$>\sptilde$} 0.6. There are 121 candidates detected at signal-to-noise ratio greater than five, at which the catalog purity is measured to be 95\%. From this high-purity subsample, we exclude the z {$<$} 0.3 clusters and use the remaining 100 candidates to improve cosmological constraints following the method presented by Benson et al. Adding the cluster data to CMB + BAO + H 0 data leads to a preference for non-zero neutrino masses while only slightly reducing the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses to {$\sum$}m {$\nu$} {$<$} 0.38 eV (95\% CL). For a spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of this catalog to the CMB + BAO + H 0 + SNe results yields {$\sigma$}8 = 0.807 {$\pm$} 0.027 and w = -1.010 {$\pm$} 0.058, improving the constraints on these parameters by a factor of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively. The larger cluster catalog presented in this work leads to slight improvements in cosmological constraints from those presented by Benson et al. These cosmological constraints are currently limited by uncertainty in the cluster mass calibration, not the size or quality of the cluster catalog. A multi-wavelength observation program to improve the cluster mass calibration will make it possible to realize the full potential of the final 2500 deg2 SPT cluster catalog to constrain cosmology.},

The halo power spectrum has a direct connection to the underlying dark matter power for k {$<$}= 0.2 h/Mpc, well into the quasi-linear regime. This enables us to use a factor of \textasciitilde 8 more modes in the cosmological analysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/Mpc, as was adopted in the SDSS team analysis of the DR4 LRG sample (Tegmark et al. 2006). The observed halo power spectrum for 0.02 {$<$} k {$<$} 0.2 h/Mpc is well-fit by our model: chi\^2 = 39.6 for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit LCDM model. We find \textbackslash Omega\_m h\^2 * (n\_s/0.96)\^0.13 = 0.141\^\{+0.009\}\_\{-0.012\} for a power law primordial power spectrum with spectral index n\_s and \textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistent with CMB measurements.

Combining the halo power spectrum measurement with the WMAP 5 year results, for the flat LCDM model we find \textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and H\_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/Mpc. Allowing for massive neutrinos in LCDM, we find \textbackslash sum m\_\{\textbackslash nu\} {$<$} 0.62 eV at the 95\% confidence level. If we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species Neff as a free parameter, we find Neff = 4.8\^\{+1.8\}\_\{-1.7\}. Combining also with the Kowalski et al.

  abstract = {The all-sky 408 MHz map of Haslam et al. is one the most important total-power radio surveys. It has been widely used to study diffuse synchrotron radiation from our Galaxy and as a template to remove foregrounds in cosmic microwave background data. However, there are a number of issues associated with it that must be dealt with, including large-scale striations and contamination from extragalactic radio sources. We have re-evaluated and reprocessed the rawest data available to produce a new and improved 408-MHz all-sky map. We first quantify the positional accuracy ({$\approx$}7 arcmin) and effective beam (56.0 {$\pm$} 1.0 arcmin) of the four individual surveys from which it was assembled. Large-scale striations associated with 1/f noise in the scan direction are reduced to a level {$\ll$}1 K using a Fourier-based filtering technique. The most important improvement results from the removal of extragalactic sources. We have used an iterative combination of two techniques - two-dimensional Gaussian fitting and minimum curvature spline surface inpainting - to remove the brightest sources ({$\greaterequivlnt$}2 Jy), which provides a significant improvement over previous versions of the map. We quantify the impact with power spectra and a template fitting analysis of foregrounds to the WMAP data. The new map is publicly available and is recommended as the template of choice for large-scale diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission. We also provide a higher resolution map with small-scale fluctuations added, assuming a power-law angular power spectrum down to the pixel scale (1.7 arcmin). This should prove useful in simulations used for studying the feasibility of detecting H I fluctuations from the Epoch of Reionization.},

The pipeline is optimized for intermediate and small scales, but could be easily extended to lower multipoles. We exploit realistic simulations of the sky, tailored for the Planck mission. The component separation is achieved by exploiting the correlated component analysis in the harmonic domain, which we demonstrate to be superior to the real-space application. We present two techniques to estimate the uncertainties on the spectral parameters of the separated components. The component separation errors are then propagated by means of Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the corresponding contributions to uncertainties on the component maps and on the CMB power spectra. For the Planck polarization case they are found to be subdominant compared to noise.},

  abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {$<$} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {$>$}= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0 {$<$} 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 {$>$}= 0.},

Our algorithm has been tested extensively on one family of mock GAMA lightcones, constructed from {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter N-body simulations populated with semi-analytic galaxies. Recovered group properties are robust to the effects of interlopers and are median unbiased in the most important respects. G3Cv1 contains 14 388 galaxy groups (with multiplicity {$\geq$}2), including 44 186 galaxies out of a possible 110 192 galaxies, implying \texttildelow 40 per cent of all galaxies are assigned to a group. The similarities of the mock group catalogues and G3Cv1 are multiple: global characteristics are in general well recovered. However, we do find a noticeable deficit in the number of high multiplicity groups in GAMA compared to the mocks. Additionally, despite exceptionally good local spatial completeness, G3Cv1 contains significantly fewer compact groups with five or more members, this effect becoming most evident for high multiplicity systems. These two differences are most likely due to limitations in the physics included of the current GAMA lightcone mock. Further studies using a variety of galaxy formation models are required to confirm their exact origin. The G3Cv1 catalogue will be made publicly available as and when the relevant GAMA redshifts are made available at .},

  abstract = {Analysing all Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) galaxies within a factor two (+/- 0.3 dex) of the stellar mass of the Milky Way (MW), there is a 11.9\% chance that one of these galaxies will have a close companion (within a projected separation of 70 kpc and radial separation of 400 km/s) that is at least as massive as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Two close companions at least as massive as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are rare at the 3.4\% level. Two full analogues to the MW- LMC-SMC system were found in GAMA (all galaxies late-type and star forming), suggesting such a combination of close together, late-type, star-forming galaxies is rare: only 0.4\% of MW mass galaxies (in the range where we could observe both the LMC and SMC) have such a system. In summary, the MW-LMC-SMC system is a 2.7? event (when recast into Gaussian statistics). Using cross-correlation comparisons we find that there is a preference for SMC- LMC binary pair analogues to be located within 2 Mpc of a range of different lumi- nosity groups. There is a particular preference is for such binaries to be located near LG luminosity systems. When these groups are subdivided into small magnitude gap and large magnitude gap subsets, the binaries prefer to be spatially associated with the small magnitude gap systems. These systems will be dynamically less evolved, but still offer the same amount of gravitational dark matter. This suggests that binaries such as the SMC-LMC might be transient systems, usually destroyed during vigorous merger events. Details of a particularly striking analogue to the MW-SMC-LMC and M31 complex are included.},

All known published and coded methods for sampling from the 3D NFW PDF use either acceptreject, or numeric interpolation (sometimes via a lookup table) for projecting random Uniform samples through the quantile distribution function to produce samples of the radius. This is a common requirement in N -body initial condition (IC), halo occupation distribution (HOD), and semi-analytic modelling (SAM) work for correctly assigning particles or galaxies to positions given an assumed concentration for the NFW profile. Using this analytic description allows for much faster and cleaner code to solve a common numeric problem in modern astronomy.

Our simulations rely on a new SIDM N-body algorithm that is derived self-consistently from the Boltzmann equation and that reproduces analytic expectations in controlled numerical experiments. We find that well-resolved SIDM haloes have constant-density cores, with significantly lower central densities than their cold dark matter (CDM) counterparts. In contrast, the subhalo content of SIDM haloes is only modestly reduced compared to CDM, with the suppression greatest for large hosts and small halo-centric distances. Moreover, the large-scale clustering and halo circular velocity functions in SIDM are effectively identical to CDM, meaning that all of the large-scale successes of CDM are equally well matched by SIDM. From our largest cross-section runs, we are able to extract scaling relations for core sizes and central densities over a range of halo sizes and find a strong correlation between the core radius of an SIDM halo and the NFW scale radius of its CDM counterpart. We construct a simple analytic model, based on CDM scaling relations, that captures all aspects of the scaling relations for SIDM haloes. Our results show that halo core densities in {$\sigma$}/m = 1 cm2 g-1 models are too low to match observations of galaxy clusters, low surface brightness spirals (LSBs) and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. However, SIDM with {$\sigma$}/m {$\simeq$} 0.1 cm2 g-1 appears capable of reproducing reported core sizes and central densities of dwarfs, LSBs and galaxy clusters without the need for velocity dependence. Higher resolution simulations over a wider range of masses will be required to confirm this expectation. We discuss constraints arising from the Bullet cluster observations, measurements of dark-matter density on small scales and subhalo survival requirements, and show that SIDM models with {$\sigma$}/m {$\simeq$} 0.1 cm2 g-1 {$\simeq$} 0.2 barn GeV-1 are consistent with all observational constraints.},

We compare the observational data with the simulated ones on a light-cone constructed from 20 subsequent outputs of the simulation. Observational effects such as incompleteness, geometry, veto masks and fiber collisions are included in the model, which reproduces within 1-\$\textbackslash sigma\$ errors the observed monopole of the 2-point correlation function at all relevant scales\{: --\} from the smallest scales, 0.5 \$h\^\{-1\}\$Mpc , up to scales beyond the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation feature. This model also agrees remarkably well with the BOSS galaxy power spectrum (up to \$k\textbackslash sim1\$ \$h\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$), and the three-point correlation function. The quadrupole of the correlation function presents some tensions with observations. We discuss possible causes that can explain this disagreement, including target selection effects. Overall, the standard HAM model describes remarkably well the clustering statistics of the CMASS sample. We compare the stellar to halo mass relation for the CMASS sample measured using weak lensing in the CFHT Stripe 82 Survey with the prediction of our clustering model, and find a good agreement within 1-\$\textbackslash sigma\$.

In representative PDM and BDM models, we find that baryons contribute decisively to the evolution of the central region, leading to an isothermal DM cusp, and thereafter to a flat DM density core\textemdash the result of heating by dynamical friction of the DM+baryon substructure during a quiescent evolution epoch. This process ablates the cold gas from an embedded disk, cutting the star formation rate by a factor of 10, and heats up the spheroidal gas and stellar components, triggering their expansion. The substructure is more resilient to the tidal disruption in the presence of baryons. The disk which formed from inside-out as gas-dominated is transformed into an intermediate Hubble type by z \textasciitilde{} 2 and to an early type by z \textasciitilde{} 0.5, based on its gas contents and spheroidal-to-disk stellar mass ratio. We find that only a relatively small \textasciitilde 20\% fraction of DM particles in PDM and BDM models are bound within the radius of maximal circular velocity in the halo, slightly less so within halo characteristic radii\textemdash most of the DM particles perform larger radial excursions. The DM particles are unbound to the cusp region. We also find that the fraction of baryons within the halo virial radius somewhat increases during the major mergers and decreases during the minor mergers. The net effect appears to be negligible\textemdash an apparent result of our choice of feedback from stellar evolution. Furthermore, we find that the DM halos are only partially relaxed beyond their virialization. While the substructure is being tidally disrupted, mixing of its debris in the halo is not efficient and becomes even less so with z. The phase-space correlations (streamers) formed after z \textasciitilde{} 1 will survive largely to the present time\textemdash an important implication for embedded disk evolution.},

We split these galaxies into five overlapping redshift shells of width 0.1 and measure w in each subsample in order to investigate the evolution of SDSS galaxies. We find that the bias increases substantially with redshift - much more so than one would expect for a passively evolving sample. We use halo-model analysis to determine the best-fit halo-occupation-distribution (HOD) for each subsample, and the best-fit models allow us to interpret the change in bias physically. In order to properly interpret our best-fit HODs, we convert each halo mass to its z = 0 passively evolved bias (bo), enabling a direct comparison of the best-fit HODs at different redshifts. We find that the minimum halo bo required to host a galaxy decreases as the redshift decreases, suggesting that galaxies with Mr {$<$} -21.2 are forming in halos at the low-mass end of the HODs over our redshift range. We use the best-fit HODs to determine the change in occupation number divided by the change in mass of halos with constant bo and we find a sharp peak at bo \textasciitilde{} 0.9 - corresponding to an average halo mass of \textasciitilde{} 10\^12Msol/h. We thus present the following scenario: the bias of galaxies with Mr {$<$} -21.2 decreases as the Universe evolves because these galaxies form in halos of mass \textasciitilde{} 10\^12Msol/h (independent of redshift), and the bias of these halos naturally decreases as the Universe evolves.},

The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project plans to utilize phased arrays in at least three different forms: as sparse and dense aperture arrays on the ground, and as phased array feeds on dishes. At frequencies above a few hundred MHz it will be vital to obtain very low noise temperature performance from these arrays in order for them to be practical as radio astronomy receivers. Receiver noise coupled between antenna elements has been thought to be a significant contributor to overall system noise in such phased arrays. This paper uses fundamental principles of noisy networks to estimate the noise waves emanating from the input of each LNA towards the antenna element. The theory has been implemented using MATLAB, and successfully used to predict the noise levels emanating from the input ports of two packaged amplifiers. The theory has been applied to an example two-antenna array model. Results from the noise wave analysis suggest that in reality the coupled noise contribution to system noise temperature should be quite small for practical low noise amplifiers of the type to be used in the SKA.},

  abstract = {For 21 Sc galaxies whose properties encompass a wide range of radii, masses, and luminosities, we have obtained major axis spectra extending to the faint outer regions, and have deduced rotation curves. The galaxies are of high inclination, so uncertainties in the angle of inclination to the line of sight and in the position angle of the major axis are minimized. Their radii range from 4 to 122 kpc (H = 50km s-1 Mpc-1); in general, the rotation curves extend to 83\% or R25i.b. When plotted on a linear scale with no scaling, the rotation curves for the smallest galaxies fall upon the initial parts of the rotation curves for the larger galaxies. All curves show a fairly rapid velocity rise to V {$\sim$} 125 km s-1 at R {$\sim$} 5 kpc, and a slower rise thereafter. Most rotation curves are rising slowly even at the farthest measured point. Neither high nor low luminosity Sc galaxies have falling rotation curves. Sc galaxies of all luminosities must have significant mass located beyond the optical image. A linear relation between log Vmax and log R follows from the shape of the common rotation curve for all Sc's, and the tendency of smaller galaxies, at any R, to have lower velocities than the large galaxies at that R. The significantly shallower slope discovered for this relation by Tully and Fisher is attributed to their use of galaxies of various Hubble types and the known correlation of Vmax with Hubble type.  The galaxies with very large central velocity gradients tend to be large, of high luminosity, with massive, dense nuclei. Often their nuclear spectra show a strong stellar continuum in the red, with emission lines of [N II] stronger than H{$\alpha$}. These galaxies also tend to be 13 cm radio continuum sources.    Because of the form of the rotation curves, small galaxies undergo many short-period, very differential, rotations. Large galaxies undergo (in their outer parts) few, only slightly differential, rotations. This suggests a relation between morphology, rotational properties, and the van den Bergh luminosity classification, which is discussed. UGC 2885, the largest Sc in the sample, has undergone fewer than 10 rotations in its outer parts since the origin of the universe but has a regular two-armed spiral pattern and no significant velocity asymmetries. This observation puts constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {Techniques for inferring the radial and geometric form of dark matter halos and the results they have produced to date are reviewed. Dark halos appear to extend to at least \textasciitilde 50kpc with total enclosed masses that rise linearly with radius R. Whether this behavior can be extrapolated to distances as large as 200kpc and beyond is controversial; results at this radius are model-dependent. Observationally, the geometrical form of the dark halo can be characterized by the equatorial axis ratio (b/a)\_{$\rho$} (ovalness) and vertical-to-equatorial axis ratio (c/a)\_{$\rho$} (flattening) of the total density. Different techniques consistently yield (b/a)\_{$\rho$} {$>$} 0.7 (and thus (b/a)\_{$\Phi$} {$>$} 0.9) at R \textasciitilde 20kpc, with more axisymmetric values, (b/a)\_{$\rho$} {$>$}= 0.8, being more likely. Results are less consistent for the vertical flattening, perhaps due to the difference in the spatial regions probed by different techniques or inappropriate assumptions. Techniques that probe furthest from the stellar plane (z \textasciitilde 15kpc) consistently implicate substantially flattened (c/a)\_{$\rho$} = 0.5 +/- 0.2 dark halos. These axis ratios are in acceptable agreement with expectations from N-body simulations of cold dark matter mixed with \textasciitilde 10\% dissipational gas.},

  abstract = {Modern scientific cosmology pushes the boundaries of knowledge and the knowable. This is prompting questions on the nature of scientific knowledge. A central issue is what defines a 'good' model. When addressing global properties of the Universe or its initial state this becomes a particularly pressing issue. How to assess the probability of the Universe as a whole is empirically ambiguous, since we can examine only part of a single realisation of the system under investigation: at some point, data will run out. We review the basics of applying Bayesian statistical explanation to the Universe as a whole. We argue that a conventional Bayesian approach to model inference generally fails in such circumstances, and cannot resolve, e.g., the so-called 'measure problem' in inflationary cosmology. Implicit and non-empirical valuations inevitably enter model assessment in these cases. This undermines the possibility to perform Bayesian model comparison. One must therefore either stay silent, or pursue a more general form of systematic and rational model assessment. We outline a generalised axiological Bayesian model inference framework, based on mathematical lattices. This extends inference based on empirical data (evidence) to additionally consider the properties of model structure (elegance) and model possibility space (beneficence). We propose this as a natural and theoretically well-motivated framework for introducing an explicit, rational approach to theoretical model prejudice and inference beyond data.},

Several experiments are planned to map the LSS over a large range of redshifts and angular scales, many of these targeting the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. It is important to model the \textbackslash HI distribution in order to correctly predict the expected signal, and more so to correctly interpret the results after the signal is detected. In this paper we have carried out semi-numerical simulations to model the \textbackslash HI distribution and study the \textbackslash HI power spectrum \$P\_\{\textbackslash HI\}(k,z)\$ across the redshift range \$1 \textbackslash le z \textbackslash le 6\$. We have modelled the \textbackslash HI bias as a complex quantity \$\textbackslash tilde\{b\}(k,z)\$ whose modulus squared \$b\^2(k,z)\$ relates \$P\_\{\textbackslash HI\}(k,z)\$ to the matter power spectrum \$P(k,z)\$, and whose real part \$b\_r(k,z)\$ quantifies the cross-correlation between the \textbackslash HI and the matter distribution. We study the \$z\$ and \$k\$ dependence of the bias, and present polynomial fits which can be used to predict the bias across \$0 \textbackslash le z \textbackslash le6\$ and \$0.01 \textbackslash le k \textbackslash le 10 \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$.

We describe the analytical approach to compute the selection function of the photometric and spectroscopic cluster surveys. Based on the photometric selection function, we forecast the constraints on a number of cosmological parameter sets corresponding to different extensions of the standard LambdaCDM model. The dynamical evolution of dark energy will be constrained to Delta w\_0=0.03 and Delta w\_a=0.2 with free curvature Omega\_k, resulting in a (w\_0,w\_a) Figure of Merit (FoM) of 291. Including the Planck CMB covariance matrix improves the constraints to Delta w\_0=0.02, Delta w\_a=0.07 and a FoM=802. The amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity, parametrised by f\_NL, will be constrained to \textbackslash Delta f\_NL \textasciitilde{} 6.6 for the local shape scenario, from Euclid clusters alone. Using only Euclid clusters, the growth factor parameter \textbackslash gamma, which signals deviations from GR, will be constrained to Delta \textbackslash gamma=0.02, and the neutrino density parameter to Delta Omega\_\textbackslash nu=0.0013 (or Delta \textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu=0.01). We emphasise that knowledge of the observable--mass scaling relation will be crucial to constrain cosmological parameters from a cluster catalogue. The Euclid mission will have a clear advantage in this respect, thanks to its imaging and spectroscopic capabilities that will enable internal mass calibration from weak lensing and the dynamics of cluster galaxies. This information will be further complemented by wide-area multi-wavelength external cluster surveys that will already be available when Euclid flies. [Abridged]},

  abstract = {We investigate the physics driving the cosmic star formation (SF) history using the more than fifty large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations that together comprise the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project. We systematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physical processes are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. Generically, we find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high redshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as it is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas exhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher redshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and to a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height of the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the present, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole feedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both boost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated fashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback from massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and accretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF law. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency is changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the same rate of production of massive stars. Self-regulated feedback from accreting black holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate below redshift two, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the form of a top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help.},

This paper describes the extension of this program to z {$>$}= 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters that provide accurate two-color rest frame B and V light curves of SNe Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range 0.25 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova (SN), and use the data to obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the z = 0.479 host galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SNe, yields an estimate for the matter density of the universe of Omega\_M=-0.2\^+1.0\_-0.8 if Omega\_Lambda = 0. For a spatially flat universe composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find Omega\_M=0.4\^+0.5\_-0.4, Omega\_Lambda=0.6\^+0.4\_-0.5.

  abstract = {The halo model is a theoretically and empirically well-motivated framework for predicting the statistics of the nonlinear matter distribution in the Universe. However, current incarnations of the halo model suffer from two major deficiencies: \$(i)\$ they do not enforce the stress-energy conservation of matter; \$(ii)\$ they are not guaranteed to recover exact perturbation theory results on large scales. Here, we provide a formulation of the halo model ("EHM") that remedies both drawbacks in a consistent way, while attempting to maintain the predictivity of the approach. In the formulation presented here, mass and momentum conservation are guaranteed, and results of perturbation theory and the effective field theory can in principle be matched to any desired order on large scales. We find that a key ingredient in the halo model power spectrum is the halo stochasticity covariance, which has been studied to a much lesser extent than other ingredients such as mass function, bias, and profiles of halos. As written here, this approach still does not describe the transition regime between perturbation theory and halo scales realistically, which is left as an open problem. We also show explicitly that, when implemented consistently, halo model predictions do not depend on any properties of low-mass halos that are smaller than the scales of interest.}

However, numerical modelling of the EoR can be prohibitively expensive for Bayesian parameter inference and how to optimally extract information from incoming data is currently unclear. Emulation techniques for fast model evaluations have recently been proposed as a way to bypass costly simulations. We consider the use of artificial neural networks as a blind emulation technique. We study the impact of training duration and training set size on the quality of the network prediction and the resulting best-fitting values of a parameter search. A direct comparison is drawn between our emulation technique and an equivalent analysis using 21CMMC. We find good predictive capabilities of our network using training sets of as low as 100 model evaluations, which is within the capabilities of fully numerical radiative transfer codes.},

We do this in two different ways: with the halo model approach and with the help of an ensemble of high-resolution N-body simulations. Combining these quasi-independent approaches leads to a physical understanding of the important processes which shape the formation of structures. We take a detailed look at the halo mass function, the concentrations and the linear halo bias of WDM. In all cases we find interesting deviations with respect to cold dark matter (CDM). In particular, the concentration-mass relation displays a turnover for group scale dark matter haloes, for the case of WDM particles with masses of the order of mWDM\texttildelow{} 0.25 keV. This may be interpreted as a hint for top-down structure formation on small scales. We implement our results into the halo model and find much better agreement with simulations.

Many attempts to simulate hot, warm, and cold dark matter cosmologies with a free streaming cutoff have been performed with cosmological particle-based simulations, but they all suffer from spurious structure formation at scales below their respective free streaming scales -- i.e. where the physics of halo formation is most affected by free streaming. We perform a series of high resolution numerical simulations of different WDM models, and develop an approximate method to subtract artificial structures in the measured halo mass function. The corrected measurements are then used to construct and calibrate an extended Press-Schechter (EPS) model with sharp-\$k\$ window function and adequate mass assignment. The EPS model gives accurate predictions for the low redshift halo mass function of CDM and WDM models, but it significantly under-predicts the halo abundance at high redshifts. By taking into account the ellipticity of the initial patches and connecting the characteristic filter scale to the smallest ellipsoidal axis, we are able to eliminate this inconsistency and obtain an accurate mass function over all redshifts and all dark matter particle masses covered by the simulations. As an additional application we use our model to predict the microhalo abundance of the standard neutralino-CDM scenario and we give the first quantitative prediction of the mass function over the full range of scales of CDM structure formation.},

As a result, we find that a conventional thermal (or thermal-like) WDM cosmology with a particle mass in agreement with Lyman {$\alpha$} is nearly indistinguishable from CDM on the relevant scales and therefore fails to alleviate any of the small-scale problems. The reason for this failure is that the power spectrum of conventional WDM falls off too rapidly.

  abstract = {Any particle dark matter (DM) scenario featuring a suppressed power spectrum of astrophysical relevance results in a delay of galaxy formation. As a consequence, such scenarios can be constrained using the global 21-cm absorption signal initiated by the UV radiation of the first stars. The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES) recently reported the first detection of such an absorption signal at redshift \$\textbackslash sim 17\$. While its amplitude might indicate the need for new physics, we solely focus on the timing of the signal to test non-cold DM models. Assuming a conservative upper limit for star-formation based on radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, we are able to derive unprecedented constraints on a variety of non-cold DM models. For example, the mass of thermal warm DM is limited to \$m\_\{\textbackslash rm TH\}{$>$}6.1\$ keV, while mixed DM scenarios (featuring a cold and a hot component) are constrained to a hot DM fraction below 17 percent. The ultra-light axion DM model is limited to masses \$m\_\{a\}{$>$}8\textbackslash times10\^\{-21\}\$ eV, a regime where its wave-like nature is pushed far below the kiloparsec scale. Finally, sterile neutrinos from resonant production can be fully disfavoured as a dominant DM candidate. The results of this paper show that the 21-cm absorption signal is a powerful discriminant of non-cold dark matter, allowing for significant improvements over to the strongest current limits. Confirming the result from EDGES is paramount in this context.},

We run cosmological simulations for the local, and nonlocal equilateral and orthogonal models and present results on the scale dependence of halo bias. We also derive a general formula for the Fourier-space bias using the peak-background split in the context of the excursion-set approach to halos and discuss the difference and similarities with the known corresponding result from local bias models. Our peak-background split bias formula generalizes previous results in the literature to include non-Markovian effects and nonuniversality of the mass function and are in better agreement with measurements in numerical simulations than previous results for a variety of halo masses, redshifts and halo definitions. We also derive for the first time quadratic bias results for arbitrary nonlocal PNG, and show that nonlinear bias loops give small corrections at large scales. The resulting well-behaved perturbation theory paves the way to constrain nonlocal PNG from measurements of the power spectrum and bispectrum in galaxy redshift surveys.},

However, the successes of the model cannot be denied, including more than 1000 sigma worth of detection of CMB anisotropy power. The model is older than most modern astrophysicists seem to appreciate, and has not fundamentally changed for more than a quarter of a century. Tensions and anomalies are often discussed, and while we should of course be open to the possibility of new physics, we should also be skeptical of the importance of 2-3 sigma differences between data sets until they become more significant. Still, today's SMC is surely not the full story and we should be looking for extensions or new ingredients to the model, guided throughout by a skeptical outlook.},

We use the WiggleZ survey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200 000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volume of \texttildelow 1 h-3 Gpc3. A new method of defining the 'homogeneity scale' is presented, which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and which can be easily compared between different surveys. Due to the large cosmic depth of WiggleZ (up to z = 1), we are able to make the first measurement of the transition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. The mean number of galaxies N({$<$} r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r3 within 1 per cent, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within 1 per cent of D2 = 3, at radii larger than 71 {$\pm$} 8 h-1Mpc at z \texttildelow{} 0.2, 70 {$\pm$} 5 h-1 Mpc at z \texttildelow{} 0.4, 81 {$\pm$} 5 h-1 Mpc at z \texttildelow{} 0.6 and 75 {$\pm$} 4 h-1 Mpc at z \texttildelow{} 0.8. We demonstrate the robustness of our results against selection function effects, using a {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) N-body simulation and a suite of inhomogeneous fractal distributions. The results are in excellent agreement with both the {$\Lambda$}CDM N-body simulation and an analytical {$\Lambda$}CDM prediction. We can exclude a fractal distribution with fractal dimension below D2 = 2.97 on scales from \texttildelow 80 h-1 Mpc up to the largest scales probed by our measurement, \texttildelow 300 h-1 Mpc, at 99.99 per cent confidence.},

We show how to infer parameters in the presence of such an estimated covariance matrix, by marginalising over the true covariance matrix, conditioned on its estimated value. This leads to a likelihood function that is no longer Gaussian, but rather an adapted version of a multivariate t-distribution, which has the same numerical complexity as the multivariate Gaussian. As expected, marginalisation over the true covariance matrix improves inference when compared with Hartlap et al.'s method, which uses an unbiased estimate of the inverse covariance matrix but still assumes that the likelihood is Gaussian.},

  abstract = {The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is expected to be detected in the next few years, either with existing instruments or by the upcoming SKA and HERA projects. In this context there is a pressing need for publicly available high-quality templates covering a wide range of possible signals. These are needed both for end-to-end simulations of the up-coming instruments, as well as to develop signal analysis methods. In this work we present such a set of templates, publicly available, for download at https://21ssd.obspm.fr/. The database contains 21-cm brightness temperature lightcones at high and low resolution, and several derived statistical quantities for 45 models spanning our choice of 3D parameter space. These data are the result of fully coupled radiative hydrodynamic high resolution (\$1024\^3\$) simulations performed with the LICORICE code. Both X-ray and Lyman line transfer is performed to account for heating and Wouthuysen-Field coupling fluctuations. We also present a first exploitation of the data using the power spectrum and the Pixel Distribution Function (PDF) as functions of redshifts, computed from lightcone data. We analyse how these two quantities behave when varying the model parameters while taking into account the thermal noise expected of a typical SKA survey. Finally, we show that the power spectrum and the PDF have different -- and to some extent complementary -- abilities to distinguish between different models. This opens the door to formulating an optimal sampling of the parameter space, dependant on the chosen diagnostics.},

When interpreted as a signature of cosmic dawn, this feature appears at the correct wavelength (corresponding to a redshift range of \$z\textbackslash approx15-20\$) but is larger by at least a factor of two in amplitude compared to the standard 21-cm models. One way to explain the excess radio absorption is by the enhancement of the diffuse radio background at \$\textbackslash nu = 1.42\$ GHz (\$\textbackslash lambda=21\$ cm) in the rest frame of the absorbing neutral hydrogen. Astrophysical scenarios, based on the acceleration of relativistic electrons by accretion on to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and by supernovae (SN) from first stars, have been proposed to produce the enhanced radio background via synchrotron emission. In this Letter we show that either the synchrotron or the inverse-Compton (IC) cooling time for such electrons is at least three orders of magnitude shorter than the duration of the EDGES signal centered at \$z \textbackslash approx 17\$, irrespective of the magnetic field strength. This means that such electrons must be replenished on a timescale orders of magnitude shorter than allowed by the cosmic history of star formation and growth of SMBHs. Thus astrophysical scenarios for excess radio background proposed to explain the EDGES signal are comfortably ruled out.},

This has allowed us to measure halo quantities in a statistically meaningful way, and for the first time analyze their distribution for a large and well-resolved sample. We characterize each halo in terms of its morphology, concentration, spin, circular velocity, and the fraction of their mass in substructure. We also identify those halos that have not yet reached a state of dynamical equilibrium, using the virial theorem with an additional correction to account for the surface pressure at the boundary. These amount to 3.4\% of our initial sample. For the virialized halos, we find a median of 5.6\% of halo mass is contained within substructure, with the distribution ranging between no identified subhalos to 65\%. The fraction of mass in substructure increases with halo mass with logarithmic slope of 0.44+/-0.06. Halos tend to have a prolate morphology, becoming more so with increasing mass. Subhalos have a greater orbital angular momentum per unit mass than their host halo. Furthermore, their orbital angular momentum is typically well aligned with that of their host. Overall, we find that dimensionless properties of dark matter halos do depend on their mass, thereby demonstrating a lack of self-similarity.},

This all-sky approach bypasses the curved-sky complications of traditional interferometry and so is particularly well-suited to the analysis of wide-field radio interferometers. It enables compact and computationally efficient representations of the data and its statistics, which allow new ways of approaching important problems like map-making and foreground removal. In particular, we show how it enables the use of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform as a highly effective foreground filter, suppressing realistic foreground residuals for our fiducial example by at least a factor 20 below the 21 cm signal, even in highly contaminated regions of the sky. This is despite the presence of the mode-mixing inherent in real-world instruments with frequency-dependent beams. We show, using Fisher forecasting, that foreground cleaning has little effect on power spectrum constraints compared to hypothetical foreground-free measurements. Beyond providing a natural real-world data analysis framework for 21 cm telescopes now under construction and future experiments, this formalism allows accurate power spectrum forecasts to be made that include the interplay of design constraints and realistic experimental systematics with 21st century 21 cm science.},

We extend this formalism to give an accurate treatment of the polarized sky, fully accounting for the effects of polarization leakage and cross polarization. We use the geometry of the measured set of visibilities to project down to pure temperature modes on the sky, serving as a significant compression, and an effective first filter of polarized contaminants. As in our previous work, we use the m-mode formalism with the Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform to give a highly efficient method for foreground cleaning, and demonstrate its success in cleaning realistic polarized skies observed with an instrument suffering from substantial off axis polarization leakage. We develop an optimal quadratic estimator in the m-mode formalism which can be efficiently calculated using a Monte Carlo technique. This is used to assess the implications of foreground removal for power spectrum constraints where we find that our method can clean foregrounds well below the foreground wedge, rendering only scales k{$\parallel<$}0.02 h Mpc-1 inaccessible. As this approach assumes perfect knowledge of the telescope, we perform a conservative test of how essential this is by simulating and analyzing data sets with deviations about our assumed telescope. Assuming no other techniques to mitigate bias are applied, we find we recover unbiased power spectra when the per-feed beamwidth to be measured to 0.1\%, and amplifier gains to be known to 1\% within each minute. Finally, as an example application, we extend our forecasts to a wideband 400\textendash 800 MHz cosmological observation and consider the implications for probing dark energy, finding a pathfinder-scale medium-sized cylinder telescope improves the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit by around 70\% over Planck and Stage II experiments alone.},

  abstract = {Recent simulations have shown the EoR 21-cm signal to be inherently  non-Gaussian whereby the error covariance matrix \$\textbackslash mathbf\{\{C\}\}\_\{ij\}\$ of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) contains a trispectrum contribution which would be absent if the signal were Gaussian. Using the binned power spectrum and trispectrum from simulations, in this paper we present a methodology for incorporating these with the baseline distribution and system noise to make error predictions for observations with any radio-interferometric array. Here we consider the upcoming SKA-Low, assuming no foreground contamination. Non-Gaussianity enhances the errors introducing a positive deviation \$\textbackslash Delta\$ relative to the Gaussian predictions. \$\textbackslash Delta\$ increases with observation time \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm obs\}\$ and saturates as the errors approach the cosmic variance. Considering \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm obs\}=1,024\$ hrs where a \$5 \textbackslash sigma\$ detection is possible at all redshifts \$7 \textbackslash le z \textbackslash le 13\$, we find that the deviations are important at small \$k\$ where we have \$\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash sim 40-100 \textbackslash\%\$ at \$k \textbackslash sim 0.04 \textasciitilde\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ for some of the redshifts and also at intermediate \$k \textbackslash, (\textbackslash sim 0.4 \textasciitilde\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\})\$ where we have \$\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash sim 200 \textbackslash\%\$ at \$z=7\$. Non-Gaussianity also introduces correlations between the errors in different \$k\$ bins, and we find both correlations and anti-correlations with the correlation coefficient value spanning \$-0.4 \textbackslash le r\_\{ij\} \textbackslash le 0.8\$. We conclude that non-Gaussianity makes a significant contribution to the errors and this is important in the context of the future instruments which aim to achieve high sensitivity measurements of the EoR 21-cm PS.},

We estimate a quasar linear bias of bQ = 1.38 {$\pm$} 0.10 at langzrang = 0.53 from the CCF measurements, which corresponds to a characteristic host halo mass of \textasciitilde 4 \texttimes{} 1012 h -1 M {$\odot$}, compared with a \textasciitilde 1013 h -1 M {$\odot$} characteristic host halo mass for CMASS galaxies. Based on the clustering measurements, most quasars at \textbackslash bar\{z\}\textbackslash sim 0.5 are not the descendants of their higher luminosity counterparts at higher redshift, which would have evolved into more massive and more biased systems at low redshift. We divide the quasar sample in luminosity and constrain the luminosity dependence of quasar bias to be dbQ /dlog L = 0.20 {$\pm$} 0.34 or 0.11 {$\pm$} 0.32 (depending on different luminosity divisions) for quasar luminosities -23.5 {$>$} Mi (z = 2) {$>$} -25.5, implying a weak luminosity dependence of clustering for luminous quasars at \textbackslash bar\{z\}\textbackslash sim 0.5. We compare our measurements with theoretical predictions, halo occupation distribution (HOD) models, and mock catalogs. These comparisons suggest that quasars reside in a broad range of host halos. The host halo mass distributions significantly overlap with each other for quasars at different luminosities, implying a poor correlation between halo mass and instantaneous quasar luminosity. We also find that the quasar HOD parameterization is largely degenerate such that different HODs can reproduce the CCF equally well, but with different satellite fractions and host halo mass distributions. These results highlight the limitations and ambiguities in modeling the distribution of quasars with the standard HOD approach.},

Comparison with these simulations shows that this simple way of estimating the bias relation and its evolution is accurate for less massive haloes as well as massive ones. In particular, we show that haloes which are less/more massive than typical M* haloes at the time they form are more/less strongly clustered than formulae based on the standard Press-Schechter mass function predict.},

This shows explicitly that the streaming motions measured in a given galaxy sample depend on how the sample was selected, and shows how to account for this dependence on sample selection. In addition, we show that the pairwise dispersion should also depend on sample type.

The result provides a good description of the evolution of {$\xi$}(r) in simulations. We then use this decomposition to provide simple and accurate models of how the single-particle velocity dispersion evolves with time, and how the first and second moments of the pairwise velocity distribution depend on scale. The key idea is to use the simple physics of linear theory on large scales, the simple physics of the virial theorem on small scales and our model for the correlation function to tell us how to weight the two types of contributions (linear and non-linear) to the pairwise velocity statistics. When incorporated into the streaming model, our results will allow a simple accurate description of redshift-space distortions over the entire range of linear to highly non-linear regimes.},

  abstract = {The excursion set approach allows one to estimate the abundance and spatial distribution of virialized dark matter haloes efficiently and accurately. The predictions of this approach depend on how the non-linear processes of collapse and virialization are modelled. We present simple analytic approximations that allow us to compare the excursion set predictions associated with spherical and ellipsoidal collapse. In particular, we present formulae for the universal unconditional mass function of bound objects and the conditional mass function which describes the mass function of the progenitors of haloes in a given mass range today. We show that the ellipsoidal collapse based moving barrier model provides a better description of what we measure in the numerical simulations than the spherical collapse based constant barrier model, although the agreement between model and simulations is better at large lookback times. Our results for the conditional mass function can be used to compute accurate approximations to the local-density mass function, which quantifies the tendency for massive haloes to populate denser regions than less massive haloes. This happens because low-density regions can be thought of as being collapsed haloes viewed at large lookback times, whereas high-density regions are collapsed haloes viewed at small lookback times. Although we have applied our analytic formulae only to two simple barrier shapes, we show that they are, in fact, accurate for a wide variety of moving barriers. We suggest how they can be used to study the case in which the initial dark matter distribution is not completely cold.},

This paper gives estimates of where the regime of applicability of Limber's equation stops. Limber's equation is accurate for small galaxy separations but breaks down beyond a certain separation that depends mainly on the ratio sigma/R and to some degree on the power-law index, gamma, of spatial clustering xi; sigma is the one-sigma width of the galaxy distribution in comoving distance, and R the mean comoving distance. As rule-of-thumb, a 10\% relative error is reached at 260 sigma/R arcmin for gamma\textasciitilde 1.6, if the spatial clustering is a power-law. More realistic xi are discussed in the paper. Limber's equation becomes increasingly inaccurate for larger angular separations. Ignoring this effect and blindly applying Limber's equation can possibly bias results for the inferred spatial correlation. It is suggested to use in cases of doubt, or maybe even in general, the exact equation that can easily be integrated numerically in the form given in the paper.},

This leads us to identify a model dependent region of optimal signal estimation for our foreground and EoR models, within which the spatial power in the EoR signal relative to foregrounds is maximised. We identify a target field dependent region, in k-space, of intrinsic foreground power spectral contamination at low k\_perp and k\_parallel and a transition to a relatively foreground-free intrinsic EoR window in the complement to this region. The contaminated region of k-space demonstrates that simultaneous estimation of the EoR and foregrounds is important for obtaining statistically robust estimates of the EoR power spectrum; biased results will be obtained from methodologies that ignore their covariance. Using simulated observations with frequency dependent uv-coverage and primary beam, with the former derived for HERA in 37-antenna and 331-antenna configuration, we recover instrumental power spectra consistent with their intrinsic counterparts. We discuss the implications of these results for optimal strategies for unbiased estimation of the EoR power spectrum.},

First, when the observations span only a small number of independent spatial frequencies (k-modes), we sample directly from the spherical power spectrum coefficients that describe the EoR signal realization. Secondly, when the number of k-modes to be included in the model becomes large, we sample from the joint probability density of the spherical power spectrum and the signal coefficients, using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to explore this high-dimensional (\texttildelow 20 000) space efficiently. This approach has been successfully applied to simulated observations that include astrophysically realistic foregrounds in a companion publication (Sims et al. 2016). Here, we focus on explaining the methodology in detail and use simple foreground models to both demonstrate its efficacy and highlight salient features. In particular, we show that including an arbitrary flat spectrum continuum foreground that is 108 times greater in power than the EoR signal has no detectable impact on our parameter estimates of the EoR power spectrum recovered from the data.},

  abstract = {Cosmic Dawn (CD), when the first stars and proto-galaxies began to form,  is commonly expected to be accompanied by an absorption signature at radio frequencies. This feature arises as Lyman {$\alpha$} photons emitted by these first luminous objects couple the 21 cm excitation temperature of intergalactic hydrogen gas to its kinetic temperature, driving it into absorption relative to the cosmic microwave background. The detailed properties of this absorption profile encode powerful information about the physics of CD. Recently, Bowman et al. analysed data from the EDGES low-band radio antenna and found an unexpectedly deep absorption profile centred at 78 MHz, which could be a detection of this signature. Their specific analysis fit their measurements using a polynomial foreground model, a flattened Gaussian absorption profile, and a white noise model; we argue that a more accurate model, that includes a detailed noise model and accounting for the effects of plausible calibration errors, is essential for describing the EDGES data set. We perform a Bayesian evidence-based comparison of models of the EDGES low-band data set and find that those incorporating these additional components are decisively preferred. The subset of the best-fitting models of the data that include a global signal favours an amplitude consistent with standard cosmological assumptions (A {$<$} 209 mK). However, there is not strong evidence to favour models of the data including a global 21 cm signal over those without one. Ultimately, we find that the derivation of robust constraints on astrophysics from the data is limited by the presence of systematics.},

  abstract = {Interpreting the small-scale clustering of galaxies with halo models can  elucidate the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos. Unfortunately, the modelling is typically not sufficiently accurate for ruling out models in a statistical sense. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the "accurate" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful treatment of statistical and systematic errors. An advantage of this approach is that it can easily incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard \$\textbackslash Lambda\textbackslash mathrm\{CDM\}\$ + halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies. Specifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity function and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model provides a good match to each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them jointly. Adding group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly tighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried (Planck cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity galaxies, but exhibits a \$2.3 \textbackslash sigma\$ tension with the clustering of luminous galaxies, thus providing evidence that the "standard" halo model needs to be extended. This work represents the most accurate modelling of small-scale clustering to-date and opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effects of warm dark matter (WDM) on the cosmic 21-cm signal. If dark matter exists as WDM instead of cold dark matter (CDM), its non-negligible velocities can inhibit the formation of low-mass haloes that normally form first in CDM models, therefore delaying star formation. The absence of early sources delays the build-up of UV and X-ray backgrounds that affect the 21-cm radiation signal produced by neutral hydrogen. With use of the 21CMFAST code, we demonstrate that the pre-reionization 21-cm signal can be changed significantly in WDM models with a free-streaming length equivalent to that of a thermal relic with mass mX of up to \texttildelow 10-20 keV. In such a WDM cosmology, the 21-cm signal traces the growth of more massive haloes, resulting in a delay of the 21-cm absorption signature and followed by accelerated X-ray heating. CDM models where astrophysical sources have a suppressed photon-production efficiency can delay the 21-cm signal as well, although its subsequent evolution is not as rapid as compared to WDM. This motivates using the gradient of the global 21-cm signal to differentiate between some CDM and WDM models. Finally, we show that the degeneracy between the astrophysics and mX can be broken with the 21-cm power spectrum, as WDM models should have a bias-induced excess of power on large scales. This boost in power should be detectable with current interferometers for models with mX {$\lessequivlnt$} 3 keV, while next-generation instruments will easily be able to measure this difference for all relevant WDM models.},

Two additional parameters (xoff and {$\rho$}rms) are used to describe the degree of 'relaxedness' of the halo. We find that we can account for much of the variance of these properties with halo mass and concentration, on the one hand, and halo relaxedness on the other. None the less, three principal components are usually required to account for most of the variance. We argue that halo mass is not as dominant as expected, which is a challenge for halo occupation models and semi-analytic models that assume that mass determines other halo (and galaxy) properties. In addition, we find that the angle {$\Phi$}L is not significantly correlated with other halo parameters, which may present a difficulty for models in which galaxy discs are oriented in haloes in a particular way. Finally, at fixed mass, we find that a halo's environment (quantified by the large-scale overdensity) is relatively unimportant.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a large library of cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law initial spectra. The non-linear evolution of the matter power spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that highly non-linear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free spectra define a non-linear locus that is clearly shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale non-linear power increases as both the power spectrum index n and the density parameter {$\Omega$} decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can be understood as resulting from the modification of dark matter haloes by continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo model' for non-linear structure; we use this approach to fit both our scale-free results and also our previous cold dark matter data. This method is more accurate than the commonly used Peacock-Dodds formula and should be applicable to more general power spectra. Code to evaluate non-linear power spectra using this method is available from {$<$}externallink type="url"{$>$}http://as1.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/\textasciitilde res/software.html{$<$}/A{$>$}.

  abstract = {We develop the halo model of large-scale structure as an accurate tool for probing primordial non-Gaussianity. In this study we focus on understanding the matter clustering at several redshifts in the context of primordial non-Gaussianity that is a quadratic correction to the local Gaussian potential, characterized by the parameter fNL. In our formulation of the halo model we pay special attention to the effect of halo exclusion and show that this can potentially solve the long-standing problem of excess power on large scales in this model. The halo model depends on the mass function, clustering of halo centers, and the density profiles. We test these ingredients using a large ensemble of high-resolution Gaussian and non-Gaussian numerical simulations, covering fNL=\{0,+100,-100\}. In particular, we provide a first exploration of how halo density profiles change in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that for fNL positive (negative) high-mass haloes have an increased (decreased) core density, so being more (less) concentrated than in the Gaussian case. We also examine the halo bias and show that, if the halo model is correct, then there is a small asymmetry in the scale dependence of the bias on very large scales, which arises because the Gaussian bias must be renormalized. We show that the matter power spectrum is modified by \texttildelow 2.5\% and \texttildelow 3.5\% on scales k\texttildelow 1.0hMpc-1 at z=0 and z=1, respectively. Our halo model calculation reproduces the absolute amplitude to within {$\lessequivlnt$}10\% and the ratio of non-Gaussian to Gaussian spectra to within {$\lessequivlnt$}1\%. We also measure the matter correlation function and find similarly good levels of agreement between the halo model and the data. We anticipate that this modeling will be useful for constraining fNL from measurements of the shear correlation function in future weak lensing surveys such as Euclid.},

This article provides a basic introduction to MCMC methods by establishing a strong conceptual understanding of what problems MCMC methods are trying to solve, why we want to use them, and how they work in theory and in practice. To develop these concepts, I outline the foundations of Bayesian inference, discuss how posterior distributions are used in practice, explore basic approaches to estimate posterior-based quantities, and derive their link to Monte Carlo sampling and MCMC. Using a simple toy problem, I then demonstrate how these concepts can be used to understand the benefits and drawbacks of various MCMC approaches.

  abstract = {WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat {$\Lambda$}-dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best-fit parameters are h=0.72+/-0.05, {$\Omega$}bh2=0.024+/-0.001, {$\Omega$}mh2=0.14+/-0.02, {$\tau$}=0.166+0.076-0.071, ns=0.99+/-0.04, and {$\sigma$}8=0.9+/-0.1. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large-scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Ly{$\alpha$} forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements, and Ly{$\alpha$} forest data to find the model's best-fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, {$\Omega$}bh2=0.0224+/-0.0009, {$\Omega$}mh2=0.135+0.008-0.009, {$\tau$}=0.17+/-0.06, ns(0.05 Mpc-1)=0.93+/-0.03, and {$\sigma$}8=0.84+/-0.04. WMAP's best determination of {$\tau$}=0.17+/-0.04 arises directly from the temperature-polarization (TE) data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. With the Ly{$\alpha$} forest data, the model favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. The significance of this running index is sensitive to the uncertainties in the Ly{$\alpha$} forest. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data, we constrain the geometry of the universe, {$\Omega$}tot=1.02+/-0.02, and the equation of state of the dark energy, w{$<$}-0.78 (95\% confidence limit assuming w{$>$}=-1). The combination of WMAP and 2dFGRS data constrains the energy density in stable neutrinos: {$\Omega\nu$}h2{$<$}0.0072 (95\% confidence limit). For three degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95\% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

Using WMAP data only, the best-fit values for cosmological parameters for the power-law flat {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) model are ({$\Omega$}mh2,{$\Omega$}bh2,h,ns,{$\tau$},{$\sigma$}8)=(0.1277+0.0080-0.0079,0.02229+/-0.00073,0.732+0.031-0.032,0.958+/-0.016,0.089+/-0.030,0.761+0.049-0.048). The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six-dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power-law spectrum, the WMAP data alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum (ns=1, r=0). Adding additional data sets improves the constraints on these components and the spectral slope. For power-law models, WMAP data alone puts an improved upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r0.002{$<$}0.65 (95\% CL) and the combination of WMAP and the lensing-normalized SDSS galaxy survey implies r0.002{$<$}0.30 (95\% CL). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale cutoff in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and small-scale CMB data than the power-law {$\Lambda$}CDM model; however, the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only {$\Delta\chi$}2=3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. Models with a running-spectral index are consistent with a higher amplitude of gravity waves. In a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) data yields a significant constraint on the equation of state of the dark energy, w=-0.967+0.073-0.072. If we assume w=-1, then the deviations from the critical density, {$\Omega$}K, are small: the combination of WMAP and the SNLS data implies {$\Omega$}k=-0.011+/-0.012. The combination of WMAP 3 year data plus the HST Key Project constraint on H0 implies {$\Omega$}k=-0.014+/-0.017 and {$\Omega\Lambda$}=0.716+/-0.055. Even if we do not include the prior that the universe is flat, by combining WMAP, large-scale structure, and supernova data, we can still put a strong constraint on the dark energy equation of state, w=-1.08+/-0.12. For a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yield a constraint on the sum of the neutrino masses, {$\Sigma$}m{$\nu<$}0.66 eV (95\%CL). Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps using Minkowski functionals, the bispectrum, trispectrum, and a new statistic designed to detect large-scale anisotropies in the fluctuations.},

Foreground cleaning methods currently used are efficient in removing spectrally smooth components. However, they struggle in the presence of not spectrally smooth contamination that is, therefore, potentially the most dangerous one. An example of this is the polarized synchrotron emission, which is Faraday rotated by the interstellar medium and leaks into total intensity due to instrumental imperfections. In this work we present new full-sky simulations of this polarized synchrotron emission in the \$50-200\$\textasciitilde MHz range, obtained from the observed properties of diffuse polarized emission at low frequencies. The simulated polarized maps are made publicly available, aiming to provide more realistic templates to simulate the effect of instrumental leakage and the effectiveness of foreground separation techniques.},

Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2\texttimes 107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

However, conflicting claims have been made with respect to radial variations of halo shape, or trends with mass. We propose a new, more robust method to determine halo shapes based on the gravitational potential, thereby avoiding measurement uncertainties that may be the cause of these discrepancies. We find a strong preference towards prolate halo shapes, with mean minor-to-major axis-ratios close to \texttildelow{} 0.5. Spherical halos are generally very rare, but there is a trend for smaller mass systems to be less elongated. We also compare dark halo shapes found in hydrodynamical simulations that include radiative cooling, star formation, and feedback processes, with those measured in equivalent collisionless simulations. Dissipation makes dark halos substantially rounder at small radii, to the extent that their shape distribution matches that of elliptical galaxies.},

  abstract = {We have performed the largest ever particle simulation of a Milky Way-sized dark matter halo, and present the most comprehensive convergence study for an individual dark matter halo carried out thus far. We have also simulated a sample of 6 ultra-highly resolved Milky-way sized halos, allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhalos with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhalos within subhalos, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhalos than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhalos than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3\% within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1\% within the Solar Circle. The inner density profiles of subhalos show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fit by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated halos are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km/s, an extrapolation over some 5 orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity, subhalos are more concentrated than field halos, with a characteristic density that is typically \textasciitilde 2.6 times larger and increases towards the halo centre.},

  abstract = {The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be a formidable instrument for the detailed study of neutral hydrogen (HI) in external galaxies and in our own Galaxy and Local Group. The sensitivity of the SKA, its wide receiver bands, and the relative freedom from radio frequency interference at the SKA sites will allow the imaging of substantial number of high-redshift galaxies in HI for the first time. It will also allow imaging of galaxies throughout the Local Volume at resolutions of {$<$}100 pc and detailed investigations of galaxy disks and the transition between disks, halos and the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the Milky Way and external galaxies. Together with deep optical and millimetre/sub-mm imaging, this will have a profound effect on our understanding of the formation, growth and subsequent evolution of galaxies in different environments. This paper provides an introductory text to a series of nine science papers describing the impact of the SKA in the field of HI and galaxy evolution. We propose a nested set of surveys with phase 1 of the SKA which will help tackle much of the exciting science described. Longer commensal surveys are discussed, including an ultra-deep survey which should permit the detection of galaxies at z=2, when the Universe was a quarter of its current age. The full SKA will allow more detailed imaging of even more distant galaxies, and allow cosmological and evolutionary parameters to be measured with exquisite precision.},

We identify subhalos within the six high-resolution dark matter halos of the Aquarius Project for which the spherically averaged potentials result in excellent fits to each of the five galaxies. In particular, our simple one-integral models reproduce the observations in the inner regions, proving that these data are fully consistent with Lambda-CDM expectations and do not require cored dark matter distributions. For four of the five satellites the fits require moderately cusped \{\textbackslash it stellar\} density profiles. The star count data for Leo I, however, do require a cored distribution of star counts. Current data suggest that these five satellites may be hosted by Lambda-CDM subhalos with maximum circular velocities in the range 10 to 30 km/s.},

It is concluded that the most accurate upper limits on neutrino rest mass can be determined by observing the gravity of relict cosmological neutrinos. It is noted that a rest mass greater than about 15 eV would be incompatible with astrophysical evidence.},

  abstract = {Cosmological parameter constraints from observations of time-delay lenses are becoming increasingly precise. However, there may be significant bias and scatter in these measurements due to, among other things, the so-called mass-sheet degeneracy. To estimate these uncertainties, we analyze strong lenses from the largest EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a mass-sheet transformation to the radial density profiles of lenses, and by selecting lenses near isothermality, we find that the bias on H0 can be reduced to 5\% with an intrinsic scatter of 10\%, confirming previous results performed on a different simulation data set. We further investigate whether combining lensing observables with kinematic constraints helps to minimize this bias. We do not detect any significant dependence of the bias on lens model parameters or observational properties of the galaxy, but depending on the source--lens configuration, a bias may still exist. Cross lenses provide an accurate estimate of the Hubble constant, while fold (double) lenses tend to be biased low (high). With kinematic constraints, double lenses show bias and intrinsic scatter of 6\% and 10\%, respectively, while quad lenses show bias and intrinsic scatter of 0.5\% and 10\%, respectively. For lenses with a reduced \$\textbackslash chi\^2 {$>$} 1\$, a power-law dependence of the \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ on the lens environment (number of nearby galaxies) is seen. Lastly, we model, in greater detail, the cases of two double lenses that are significantly biased. We are able to remove the bias, suggesting that the remaining biases could also be reduced by carefully taking into account additional sources of systematic uncertainty.},

For a wide range of survey volumes, the sample variance that arises from modes that are larger than the survey dominates the covariance of power spectrum estimators for modes much smaller than the survey. The deeply nonlinear version of this effect is known as halo sample variance. We show that all variants are unified by the matter trispectrum of squeezed configurations and that such configurations obey a consistency relation which relates them to the response of the power spectrum to a change in the background density. Our method also applies to statistics that are based on radial projections of the density field such as weak lensing shear. While we use the halo model for an analytic description to expose the nature of the effect, the consistency description enables an accurate calibration of the full effect directly from simulations. It also suggests that super-sample covariance may be viewed as an additional interesting signal rather than excess noise.},

While the halofit model has been frequently used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, its precision has been limited by the low-resolution of \$N\$-body simulations used to determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of improved fitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. We run high-resolution \$N\$-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) best-fit cosmological parameters (1, 3, 5, and 7 year results), including dark energy models with a constant equation of state. The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fitting parameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra of the \$N\$-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. The revised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a wide range of wavenumber (\$k \textbackslash leq 30h\$\textbackslash,Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$) at redshifts \$0 \textbackslash leq z \textbackslash leq 10\$, with 5\% precision for \$k\textbackslash leq1 h\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ at \$0 \textbackslash leq z \textbackslash leq 10\$ and 10\% for \$1 \textbackslash leq k\textbackslash leq 10 h\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\} \$ at \$0 \textbackslash leq z \textbackslash leq 3\$.

We find that most MAHs have a similar shape: an early merger-dominated mass increase followed by a more gradual accretion-dominated growth. For some clusters the intense merger activity and rapid mass growth continue until the present-day epoch. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the concentration of the density distribution is tightly correlated with the halo's MAH and with its formation redshift. During the period of fast mass growth, the concentration remains approximately constant and low, cv\textasciitilde 3-4, while during the slow accretion stages the concentration increases with decreasing redshift as cv\textasciitilde (1+z)-1. We consider fits of three widely discussed analytic density profiles to the simulated clusters, focusing on the most relaxed inner regions. We find that there is no unique best-fit analytic profile for all the systems. At the same time, if a cluster is best fitted by a particular analytic profile at z=0, the same is usually true at earlier epochs out to z\textasciitilde 1-2. The local logarithmic slope of the density profiles at 3\% of the virial radius ranges from -1.2 to -2.0, a remarkable diversity for the relatively narrow mass range of our cluster sample. Interestingly, for all the studied clusters the logarithmic slope down to the smallest resolved scale ({$<\sptilde$}1\% of the virial radius) becomes shallower with decreasing radius without reaching an asymptotic value. We do not find a clear correlation of the inner slope with the formation redshift or the shape of the halo's MAH. We do find, however, that during the period of rapid mass growth the density profiles can be well described by a single power law {$\rho$}(r)\textasciitilde r-{$\gamma$} with {$\gamma\sptilde$}1.5-2. The relatively shallow power-law slopes result in low concentrations at these stages of evolution, as the scale radius at which the density profiles reach the slope of -2 is at large radii. This indicates that the inner power law-like density distribution of halos is built up during the periods of rapid mass accretion and active merging, while the outer steeper profile is formed when the mass accretion slows down. To check the convergence and robustness of our conclusions, we resimulate one of our clusters by using 8 times as many particles and twice as good force resolution. We find good agreement between the two simulations in all the results discussed in our study.},

  abstract = {The balance of evidence indicates that individual galaxies and groups or clusters of galaxies are embedded in enormous distributions of cold, weakly interacting dark matter. These dark matter 'halos' provide the scaffolding for all luminous structure in the universe, and their properties comprise an essential part of the current cosmological model. I review the internal properties of dark matter halos, focussing on the simple, universal trends predicted by numerical simulations of structure formation. Simulations indicate that halos should all have roughly the same spherically-averaged density profile and kinematic structure, and predict simple distributions of shape, formation history and substructure in density and kinematics, over an enormous range of halo mass and for all common variants of the concordance cosmology. I describe observational progress towards testing these predictions by measuring masses, shapes, profiles and substructure in real halos, using baryonic tracers or gravitational lensing. An important property of simulated halos (possibly the most important property) is their dynamical 'age', or degree of internal relaxation. The age of a halo may have almost as much effect as its mass in determining the state of its baryonic contents, so halo ages are also worth trying to measure observationally. I review recent gravitational lensing studies of galaxy clusters which should measure substructure and relaxation in a large sample of individual cluster halos, producing quantitative measures of age that are well-matched to theoretical predictions. The age distributions inferred from these studies will lead to second-generation tests of the cosmological model, as well as an improved understanding of cluster assembly and the evolution of galaxies within clusters.},

  abstract = {A new method for estimating the angular power spectrum C\textsubscript{l} from cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps is presented, which has the following desirable properties. (1) It is unbeatable in the sense that no other method can measure C\textsubscript{l} with smaller error bars. (2) It is quadratic, which makes the statistical properties of the measurements easy to compute and use for estimation of cosmological parameters. (3) It is computationally faster than rival high-precision methods such as the nonlinear maximum-likelihood technique, with the crucial steps scaling as n\textsuperscript{2} rather than n\textsuperscript{3}, where n is the number of map pixels. (4) It is applicable to any survey geometry whatsoever, with arbitrary regions masked out and arbitrary noise behavior. (5) It is not a ``black-box'' method, but quite simple to understand intuitively: it corresponds to a high-pass filtering and edge softening of the original map followed by a straight expansion in truncated spherical harmonics. It is argued that this method is computationally feasible even for future high-resolution CMB experiments with n\textasciitilde 10\textsuperscript{6}-10\textsuperscript{7}. It is shown that C\textsubscript{l} computed with this method is useful not merely for graphical presentation purposes, but also as an intermediate (and arguably necessary) step in the data analysis pipeline, reducing the data set to a more manageable size before the final step of constraining Gaussian cosmological models and parameters - while retaining all the cosmological information that was present in the original map.},

We present a rigorous discussion of different methods of power spectrum estimation, with emphasis on the traditional Fourier method and linear (Karhunen-Lo\`eve KL) and quadratic data compression schemes, showing in what approximations they give the same result. To improve speed, we show how many of the advantages of KL data compression and power spectrum estimation may be achieved with a computationally faster quadratic method. To improve accuracy, we derive analytic expressions for handling the integral constraint, since it is crucial that finite volume effects are accurately corrected for on scales comparable to the depth of the survey. We also show that for the KL and quadratic techniques, multiple constraints can be included via simple matrix operations, thereby rendering the results less sensitive to Galactic extinction and misestimates of the radial selection function. We present a data analysis pipeline that we argue does justice to the increases in both quality and quantity of data that upcoming redshift surveys will provide. It uses three analysis techniques in conjunction: a traditional Fourier approach on small scales, a pixelized quadratic matrix method on large scales, and a pixelized KL eigenmode analysis to probe anisotropic effects such as redshift-space distortions.},

The electric field is digitized by antennas on a rectangular grid, after which a series of Fast Fourier Transforms recovers simultaneous multifrequency images of up to half the sky. Thanks to Moore's law, the bandwidth up to which this is feasible has now reached about 1 GHz, and will likely continue doubling every couple of years. The main advantages over a single dish telescope are cost and orders of magnitude larger field-of-view, translating into dramatically better sensitivity for large-area surveys. The key advantages over traditional interferometers are cost (the correlator computational cost for an N-element array scales as N log N rather than N\^2) and a compact synthesized beam. We argue that 21 cm tomography could be an ideal first application of a very large Fast Fourier Transform Telescope, which would provide both massive sensitivity improvements per dollar and mitigate the off-beam point source foreground problem with its clean beam. Another potentially interesting application is cosmic microwave background polarization.},

We show that all correlations for such a 2D array with an n-level hierarchy can be efficiently computed via a Fast Fourier Transform in not 2 but 2n dimensions. This can allow major correlator cost reductions for science applications requiring exquisite sensitivity at widely separated angular scales, for example 21cm tomography (where short baselines are needed to probe the cosmological signal and long baselines are needed for point source removal), helping enable future 21cm experiments with thousands or millions of cheap dipole-like antennas. Such hierarchical grids combine the angular resolution advantage of traditional array layouts with the cost advantage of a rectangular Fast Fourier Transform Telescope. We also describe an algorithm for how a subclass of hierarchical arrays can efficiently use rotation synthesis to produce global sky maps with minimal noise and a well-characterized synthesized beam.},

There is also a brief discussion of some aspects of scattering by irregularities in the propagation medium.

The terminology is sometimes different from that which has evolved in radio interferometry, but many of the physical situations are similar or identical. However, in spite of the similarity, the literature shows that in the early development of radio astronomy, the optical experience was hardly ever mentioned, an exception being the reference by Bracewell (1958) to Zernike (1938) for the concept of the complex degree of coherence.

  abstract = {A basic requirement of radio astronomy is access to a spectrum in which observations can be made without detrimental interference from transmissions by other services. In the early years of radio astronomy, when most of the radio astronomy bands below a few GHz were allocated, bandwidths of radio astronomy systems were generally no greater than a few MHz, and the comparable allocated bandwidths largely sufficed. Some allocations were made for radio lines, most importantly the hydrogen (H1) line, for which 1420\textendash 1427 MHz was reserved. In the following decades, as radio astronomy at frequencies in the range of tens of GHz developed, bandwidths of order 1 GHz were allocated, and later, a substantial fraction of the spectrum above {$\sim$} 100 GHz was allocated to radio astronomy. However, spillover of radiation from transmitting services into radio astronomy bands occurs, and generally it has been necessary to choose observatory sites in radio-quiet areas of low population density and to take advantage of terrain shielding where possible. These considerations have led to the choice of sites in South Africa and Western Australia for international development of several of the largest arrays. Also, with the increase in computing capacity at observatories, detection and removal of interfering signals in astronomical observations have become important parts of data analysis. In particular, digital analysis allows the received bandwidths to be divided into as many as 106 spectral channels, which allows those containing interference to be identified and removed. A general discussion of interference in radio astronomy is given by Baan (2010).},

  abstract = {The subject of this book can be broadly described as the principles of radio interferometry applied to the measurement of natural radio signals from cosmic sources. The uses of such measurements lie mainly within the domains of astrophysics, astrometry, and geodesy. As an introduction, we consider in this chapter the applications of the technique, some basic terms and concepts, and the historical development of the instruments and their uses.The fundamental concept of this book is that the image, or intensity distribution, of a source has a Fourier transform that is the two-point correlation function of the electric field, whose components can be directly measured by an interferometer. This Fourier transform is normally called the fringe visibility function, which in general is a complex quantity. The basic formulation of this principle is called the van Cittert\textendash Zernike theorem(see Chap. 15), derived in the 1930s in the context of optics but not widely appreciated by radio astronomers until the publication of the well-known textbook Principles of Opticsby Born and Wolf (1959). The techniques of radio interferometry developed from those of the Michelson stellar interferometer without specific knowledge of the van Cittert\textendash Zernike theorem. Many of the principles of interferometry have counterparts in the field of X-ray crystallography (seeBeevers and Lipson 1985).},

In digital delay circuits, the accuracy of the delay depends on the accuracy of the timing pulses in the system, and long delays accurate to tens of picoseconds are more easily achieved digitally than by using analog delay lines. Furthermore, there is no distortion of the signal by the digital units other than the calculable effects of quantization. In contrast, with an analog system, it is difficult to keep the shape of the frequency response within tolerances while delay elements are switched into and out of the signal channels. Correlators with wide dynamic range are readily implemented digitally, including those with multichannel output, as needed for spectral line observations. Analog multichannel correlators employ filter banks to divide the signal passband into many narrow channels. Such filters, when subject to temperature variations, can be a source of phase instability. Finally, except at the highest bit rates (frequencies), digital circuits need less adjustment than analog ones and are better suited to replication in large numbers for large arrays.},

This was accomplished by recording the data on magnetic tape for later cross-correlation at a central processing station. The technique was called very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), a term recalling the earlier long-baseline interferometers at Jodrell Bank Observatory, in which the elements were connected by microwave links that had reached 127 km in length. The principles involved in VLBI are fundamentally the same as those involved in interferometers with connected elements. The tape recorder and its successor, disk storage, can be considered as an IF delay line of limited capacity with an unusually long propagation time, weeks instead of microseconds. The use of tape and disk recording media is motivated entirely by economics and places substantial limitations on the system. Satellite links have been demonstrated (Yen et al. 1977), but their high cost discourages their use.},

The trend in technology has been to convert signals as early as possible in the signal chain, following the antennas, into digital form to facilitate data handling, avoid low-level distortions, and generally take advantage of the rapid progress in the development of digital equipment and computers. Three key items are discussed: (1) low noise amplification of signals at the antenna output to minimize the effect of additive noise, (2) phase-stable transmission systems that allow the transfer of reference timing and phase signals from the central communications hub of the instrument to the antennas, and (3) the synchronous phase switching systems needed to eliminate spurious responses in the correlator output. The analysis here leads to specification of tolerances on system parameters that are necessary to achieve the goals of sensitivity and accuracy.},

The effects of scattering in other galaxies or in the media between galaxies are not usually important. There are several essential differences between neutral and ionized media with regard to propagation. For neutral media, the index of refraction is greater than unity and is unaffected by magnetic fields. In ionized media, the index of refraction is less than unity and is strongly affected by magnetic fields. Most plasma phenomena scale as {$\nu-$}2, and their effects can be avoided or mitigated, if desired, by observations at high frequency. Absorption plays an important role in neutral media but very little in ionized media since most radio astronomical observations occur at frequencies far above the plasma frequency. Descriptions of scattering phenomena in both types of media are based on Kolmogorov theory. However, the situation in the neutral troposphere is greatly simplified because the turbulent layer lies close to the observer, and only phase fluctuations develop. The ionized media lie far from the observer, and both phase and amplitude fluctuations are often present in the wavefront when it reaches the observer.},

We derive limits on the sensitivity of a Fourier synthesis telescope to detect EoR based on its array configuration and a statistical representation of images made by the instrument. We use the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) configuration for our studies. Using a unified framework for estimating signal and noise components in the H I power spectrum, we derive an expression for and estimate the contamination from extragalactic point-like sources in three-dimensional k -space. Sensitivity for EoR H I power spectrum detection is estimated for different observing modes with MWA. With 1000 hr of observing on a single field using the 128 tile MWA, EoR detection is feasible (S/N {$>$}1 for k \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] lsim 0.8 Mpc \textendash 1 ). Bandpass shaping and refinements to the EoR window are found to be effective in containing foreground contamination, which makes the instrument tolerant to imaging errors. We find that for a given observing time, observing many independent fields of view does not offer an advantage over a single field observation when thermal noise dominates over other uncertainties in the derived power spectrum.},

  abstract = {Detection of 21 cm emission of H i from the epoch of reionization, at redshifts z\textbackslash gt 6, is limited primarily by foreground emission. We investigate the signatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using the delay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground object locations through signal delays between antenna pairs. We demonstrate interferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including the largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements. These wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapes impact their amplitudes substantially. A dish-shaped antenna yields the most desirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to a dipole or a phased array. Comparing data from recent Murchison Widefield Array observations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have the largest impact on the H i signal arise from power received far away from the primary field of view. We identify diffuse emission near the horizon as a significant contributing factor, even on wide antenna spacings that usually represent structures on small scales. For signals entering through the primary field of view, compact emission dominates the foreground contamination. These two mechanisms imprint a characteristic pitchfork signature on the ``foreground wedge'' in Fourier delay space. Based on these results, we propose that selective down-weighting of data based on antenna spacing and time can mitigate foreground contamination substantially by a factor of {$\sim$}100 with negligible loss of sensitivity.},

Upcoming experiments are faced with a challenge to deliver more collecting area per antenna element without degrading the data with systematics. This paper and its companions show that dishes are viable for achieving this balance using the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) as an example. Here, we specifically identify spectral systematics associated with the antenna power pattern as a significant detriment to all EoR experiments which causes the already bright foreground power to leak well beyond ideal limits and contaminate the otherwise clean EoR signal modes. A primary source of this chromaticity is reflections in the antenna-feed assembly and between structures in neighboring antennas. Using precise foreground simulations taking wide-field effects into account, we provide a framework to set cosmologically-motivated design specifications on these reflections to prevent further EoR signal degradation. We show HERA will not be impeded by such spectral systematics and demonstrate that even in a conservative scenario that does not perform removal of foregrounds, HERA will detect EoR signal in line-of-sight \$k\$-modes, \$k\_\textbackslash parallel \textbackslash gtrsim 0.2\textbackslash,h\$\textasciitilde Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$, with high significance.

We propose to mitigate this calibration requirement by using measurements of the interferometric bi-spectrum phase. Bi-spectrum phase is unaffected by antenna-based direction-independent calibration errors and hence for a compact array it depends on the sky brightness distribution only (subject to the usual thermal-like noise). We show that the bi-spectrum phase of foreground synchrotron continuum has a characteristically smooth spectrum relative to the cosmological line signal. The two can be separated effectively by exploiting this spectral difference using Fourier techniques, while eliminating the need for precise antenna-based calibration of phases introduced by the instrument, and the ionosphere, inherent in existing approaches. Using fiducial models for continuum foregrounds, and for the cosmological H\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash sc i\} signal, we show the latter should be detectable in bi-spectrum phase spectra, with reasonable significance at \$|k\_\textbackslash parallel| \textbackslash gtrsim 0.5\textbackslash,h\$\textasciitilde Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$, using existing instruments. Our approach will also benefit other H\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash sc i\} intensity mapping experiments that face similar challenges, such as those measuring Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).},

Halos are identified using the spherical overdensity algorithm, which finds the mass around isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean density is {$\Delta$} times the background. We calibrate fitting functions for the large-scale bias that are adaptable to any value of {$\Delta$} we examine. We find a \textasciitilde 6\% scatter about our best-fit bias relation. Our fitting functions couple to the halo mass functions of Tinker et al. such that the bias of all dark matter is normalized to unity. We demonstrate that the bias of massive, rare halos is higher than that predicted in the modified ellipsoidal collapse model of Sheth et al. and approaches the predictions of the spherical collapse model for the rarest halos. Halo bias results based on friends-of-friends halos identified with linking length 0.2 are systematically lower than for halos with the canonical {$\Delta$} = 200 overdensity by \textasciitilde 10\%. In contrast to our previous results on the mass function, we find that the universal bias function evolves very weakly with redshift, if at all. We use our numerical results, both for the mass function and the bias relation, to test the peak-background split model for halo bias. We find that the peak-background split achieves a reasonable agreement with the numerical results, but \textasciitilde 20\% residuals remain, both at high and low masses.},

Our w\_p measurements are obtained from DR7 while the sample of clusters is the maxBCG sample, with cluster masses derived from weak gravitational lensing. We construct non-linear galaxy bias models using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) to fit both w\_p and M/N for different cosmological parameters. HOD models that match the same two-point clustering predict different numbers of galaxies in massive halos when Omega\_m or sigma\_8 is varied, thereby breaking the degeneracy between cosmology and bias. We demonstrate that this technique yields constraints that are consistent and competitive with current results from cluster abundance studies, even though this technique does not use abundance information. Using w\_p and M/N alone, we find Omega\_m\^0.5*sigma\_8=0.465+/-0.026, with individual constraints of Omega\_m=0.29+/-0.03 and sigma\_8=0.85+/-0.06. Combined with current CMB data, these constraints are Omega\_m=0.290+/-0.016 and sigma\_8=0.826+/-0.020. All errors are 1-sigma. The systematic uncertainties that the M/N technique are most sensitive to are the amplitude of the bias function of dark matter halos and the possibility of redshift evolution between the SDSS Main sample and the maxBCG sample. Our derived constraints are insensitive to the current level of uncertainties in the halo mass function and in the mass-richness relation of clusters and its scatter, making the M/N technique complementary to cluster abundances as a method for constraining cosmology with future galaxy surveys.},

For massive galaxies, M * {$>\sptilde$} 1010.6 M \&sun;, our results indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M * \textasciitilde{} 1010 M \&sun;, the fraction of central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z = 0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters is losing efficiency.},

ZFOURGE provides well- constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deepmedium-bandwidth imaging at 1\textendash 2\textmu m. We combine this with HST imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses {$\sim$} 109.5M{$\odot$} at z {$\sim$} 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z {$\leq$} 1 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the stellar mass function (SMF), leading to an upturn at masses {$<$} 1010M{$\odot$} that is not well-described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z {$\sim$} 2, and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M{${_\ast}$}) and slope at the lowest masses ({$\alpha$}) of a double- Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/M{$\odot$}) {$\sim$} 10.65 and {$\sim$} -1.5 respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. This is not the case for quiescent galaxies: the depth of our imaging allows us to show for the first time significantly more evolution at Log(M/M{$\odot$}) {$<$} 10.5 than at higher masses. We find that the total mass density (down to 109M{$\odot$}) in star-forming galaxies has increased by a factor of {$\sim$}2.2 since z {$\approx$} 2.5, whereas in quiescent galaxies it has increased by a factor of {$\sim$}12 .},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure and dynamical evolution of dark matter haloes in clusters of galaxies. Our sample consists of nine massive haloes from an Einstein-De Sitter universe with scale-free power spectrum and spectral index n=-1. Haloes are resolved by 20 000 particles each, on average, and have a dynamical resolution of 20-25 kpc, as shown by extensive tests. Large-scale tidal fields are included up to a scale L=150 Mpc using background particles. We find that the halo formation process can be characterized by the alternation of two dynamical configurations: a merging phase and a relaxation phase, defined by their signature on the evolution of the total mass and root mean square (rms) velocity. Haloes spend on average one- third of their evolution in the merging phase and two-thirds in the relaxation phase. Using this definition, we study the density profiles and show how they change during the halo dynamical history. In particular, we find that the average density profiles of our haloes are fitted by the Navarro, Frenk \& White analytical model with an rms residual of 17 per cent between the virial radius R\_v and 0.01R\_v. The Hernquist analytical density profile fits the same haloes with an rms residual of 26 per cent. The trend with mass of the scale radius of these fits is marginally consistent with that found by Cole \& Lacey: compared with their results our haloes are more centrally concentrated, and the relation between scale radius and halo mass is slightly steeper. We find a moderately large scatter in this relation, due both to dynamical evolution within haloes and to fluctuations in the halo population. We analyse the dynamical equilibrium of our haloes using the Jeans equation, and find that on average they are approximately in equilibrium within their virial radius. Finally, we find that the projected mass profiles of our simulated haloes are in very good agreement with the profiles of three rich galaxy clusters derived from strong and weak gravitational lensing observations.},

  abstract = {Precise subtraction of foreground sources is crucial for detecting and estimating 21 cm H I signals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We quantify how imperfect point-source subtraction due to limitations of the measurement data set yields structured residual signal in the data set. We use the Cramer-Rao lower bound, as a metric for quantifying the precision with which a parameter may be measured, to estimate the residual signal in a visibility data set due to imperfect point-source subtraction. We then propagate these residuals into two metrics of interest for 21 cm EoR experiments\textemdash the angular power spectrum and two-dimensional power spectrum\textemdash using a combination of full analytic covariant derivation, analytic variant derivation, and covariant Monte Carlo simulations. This methodology differs from previous work in two ways: (1) it uses information theory to set the point-source position error, rather than assuming a global rms error, and (2) it describes a method for propagating the errors analytically, thereby obtaining the full correlation structure of the power spectra. The methods are applied to two upcoming low-frequency instruments that are proposing to perform statistical EoR experiments: the Murchison Widefield Array and the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization. In addition to the actual antenna configurations, we apply the methods to minimally redundant and maximally redundant configurations. We find that for peeling sources above 1 Jy, the amplitude of the residual signal, and its variance, will be smaller than the contribution from thermal noise for the observing parameters proposed for upcoming EoR experiments, and that optimal subtraction of bright point sources will not be a limiting factor for EoR parameter estimation. We then use the formalism to provide an ab initio analytic derivation motivating the "wedge" feature in the two-dimensional power spectrum, complementing previous discussion in the literature.},

  abstract = {Noise considerations for experiments that aim to statistically estimate the 21 cm signal from high redshift neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) using interferometric data are typically computed assuming a tracked observation, where the telescope pointing centre and instrument phase centre are the same over the observation. Current low frequency interferometers use aperture arrays of fixed dipoles, which are steered electronically on the sky, and have different properties to mechanically-steered single apertures, such as reduced sensitivity away from zenith, and discrete pointing positions on the sky. These properties encourage the use of two additional observing modes: (1) zenith drift, where the pointing centre remains fixed at the zenith, and the phase centre tracks the sky, and (2) drift + shift, a hybrid mode where the telescope uses discrete pointing centres, and the sky drifts during each fixed pointing. These three observing modes view the sky differently, and therefore yield different uncertainties in the power spectrum according to the balance of radiometric noise and cosmic variance. The coherence of measurements made by the instrument in these modes dictates the optimal reduction in thermal noise by combination of coherent modes, and the reduction in cosmic variance by combination of incoherent modes (views of different patches of the sky). Along with calibration and instrument stability considerations, the balance between these noise components provides one measure for the utility of these three modes for measuring a statistical signature of the EoR signal. We provide a general framework for estimating the uncertainty in the power spectrum for a given observing mode, telescope beam shape, and interferometer antenna distribution. We then apply this framework to the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) using an analysis of the two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) power spectra for 900 hours of observing. We demonstrate that zenith drift scans can yield marginally lower uncertainty in the signal power compared with tracked scans for the MWA EoR experiment, and that moderately higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) estimates of the amplitude (3\%) and slope (1\%) of the 1D power spectrum are accessible, translating directly into a reduction in the required observing time to reach the same estimation precision. We find that the additional sensitivity of pointing at zenith, and the reduction in cosmic variance available with a zenith drift scan, makes this an attractive observing mode for current and future arrays.},

We describe instrument calibration choices that influence the spectral characteristics of the science data, and assess their impact on EoR/CD statistical and tomographic experiments. Principally, we consider the intrinsic spectral response of the antennas, embedded within a complete frequency-dependent primary beam response, and instrument sampling. The analysis is applied to the proposed SKA1-Low EoR/CD experiments. We provide tolerances on the smoothness of the SKA station primary beam bandpass, to meet the scientific goals of statistical and tomographic (imaging) of EoR/CD programs. Two calibration strategies are tested: (1) fitting of each fine channel independently, and (2) fitting of an nth-order polynomial for each \textasciitilde{} 1 MHz coarse channel with (n+1)th-order residuals (n = 2, 3, 4). Strategy (1) leads to uncorrelated power in the 2D power spectrum proportional to the thermal noise power, thereby reducing the overall sensitivity. Strategy (2) leads to correlated residuals from the fitting, and residual signal power with (n+1)th-order curvature. For the residual power to be less than the thermal noise, the fractional amplitude of a fourth-order term in the bandpass across a single coarse channel must be {$<$} 2.5\% (50 MHz), {$<$} 0.5\% (150 MHz), {$<$} 0.8\% (200 MHz). The tomographic experiment places constraints on phase residuals in the bandpass. We find that the root-mean-square variability over all stations of the change in phase across any fine channel (4.578 kHz) should not exceed 0.2 degrees.},

  abstract = {The Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization, during which collapsed  structures produce the first ionizing photons and proceed to reionize the intergalactic medium, span a large range in redshift (z \texttildelow{} 30-6) and time (tage \texttildelow{} 0.1-1.0 Gyr). Exploration of these epochs using the redshifted 21 cm emission line from neutral hydrogen is currently limited to statistical detection and estimation metrics (e.g. the power spectrum) due to the weakness of the signal. Brightness temperature fluctuations in the line-of-sight dimension are probed by observing the emission line at different frequencies, and their structure is used as a primary discriminant between the cosmological signal and contaminating foreground extragalactic and Galactic continuum emission. Evolution of the signal over the observing bandwidth leads to the `line cone effect' whereby the H I structures at the start and end of the observing band are not statistically consistent, yielding a biased estimate of the signal power, and potential reduction in signal detectability. We implement a wavelet transform to wide bandwidth radio interferometry experiments to probe the local statistical properties of the signal. We show that use of the wavelet transform yields estimates with improved estimation performance, compared with the standard Fourier Transform over a fixed bandwidth. With the suite of current and future large bandwidth reionization experiments, such as with the 300 MHz instantaneous bandwidth of the Square Kilometre Array, a transform that retains local information will be important.},

  abstract = {Detection of the cosmological neutral hydrogen signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and estimation of its basic physical parameters are principal scientific aims of many current low-frequency radio telescopes. Here we describe the Cosmological H i Power Spectrum Estimator (CHIPS), an algorithm developed and implemented with data from the Murchison Widefield Array, to compute the two-dimensional and spherically-averaged power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations. The principal motivations for CHIPS are the application of realistic instrumental and foreground models to form the optimal estimator, thereby maximizing the likelihood of unbiased signal estimation, and allowing a full covariant understanding of the outputs. CHIPS employs an inverse-covariance weighting of the data through the maximum likelihood estimator, thereby allowing use of the full parameter space for signal estimation (``foreground suppression''). We describe the motivation for the algorithm, implementation, application to real and simulated data, and early outputs.

The information contained in a calibration model about the spatial and spectral structure of an extended source is incomplete because a radio telescope cannot sample all Fourier components. Application of an incomplete sky model to calibration of Epoch of Reionisation data will imprint residual error in the data, which propagates forward to the Epoch of Reionisation power spectrum. This limited information is studied in the context of current and future planned instruments and surveys at Epoch of Reionisation frequencies, such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA1-Low). For the MWA Epoch of Reionisation experiment, we find that both the additional short baseline uv-coverage of the compact Epoch of Reionisation array, and the additional long baselines provided by TGSS and planned MWA expansions, are required to obtain sufficient information on all relevant scales. For SKA1-Low, arrays with maximum baselines of 49 km and 65 km yield comparable performance at 50 MHz and 150 MHz, while 39 km, 14 km, and 4 km arrays yield degraded performance.},

  abstract = {Structure imprinted in foreground extragalactic point sources by ionospheric refraction has the potential to contaminate Epoch of Reionization (EoR) power spectra of the 21 cm emission line of neutral hydrogen. The alteration of the spatial and spectral structure of foreground measurements due to total electron content gradients in the ionosphere creates a departure from the expected sky signal. We present a general framework for understanding the signatures of ionospheric behavior in the 2D neutral hydrogen power spectrum measured by a low-frequency radio interferometer. Two primary classes of ionospheric behavior are considered, corresponding to dominant modes observed in Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) EoR data, namely, anisotropic structured wave behavior and isotropic turbulence. Analytic predictions for power spectrum bias due to this contamination are computed and compared with simulations. We then apply the ionospheric metric described in Jordan et al. to study the impact of ionospheric structure on MWA data, by dividing MWA EoR data sets into classes with good and poor ionospheric conditions, using sets of matched 30-minute observations from 2014 September. The results are compared with the analytic and simulated predictions, demonstrating the observed bias in the power spectrum when the ionosphere is active (displays coherent structures or isotropic turbulence). The analysis demonstrates that unless ionospheric activity can be quantified and corrected, active data should not be included in EoR analysis in order to avoid systematic biases in cosmological power spectra. When data are corrected with a model formed from the calibration information, bias reduces below the expected 21 cm signal level. Data are considered ``quiet'' when the median measured source position offsets are less than 10.{${''}$}-15.{${''}$}.},

A Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) is introduced for measuring the spatial temperature fluctuation power spectrum from the EoR. The KDE estimates the underlying probability distribution function of fluctuations as a function of spatial scale, and contains different systematic biases and errors to the typical approach to estimating the fluctuation power spectrum. Extraction of histograms of visibilities allows moments analysis to be used to discriminate foregrounds from 21 cm signal and thermal noise. We use the information available in the histograms, along with the statistical dis-similarity of foregrounds from two independent observing fields, to robustly separate foregrounds from cosmological signal, while making no assumptions about the Gaussianity of the signal. Using two independent observing fields to robustly discriminate signal from foregrounds is crucial for the analysis presented in this paper. We apply the techniques to 13 h of Murchison Widefield Array EoR data over two observing fields. We compare the output to that obtained with a comparative power spectrum estimation method, and demonstrate the reduced foreground contamination using this approach. Using the second moment obtained directly from the KDE distribution functions yields a factor of 2-3 improvement in power for k \&lt; 0.3 h Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} compared with a matched delay space power estimator, while weighting data by additional statistics does not offer significant improvement beyond that available for thermal noise-only weights.},

  abstract = {These notes aim at presenting an overview of Bayesian statistics, the un-derlying concepts and application methodology that will be useful to astronomers seeking to analyse and interpret a wide variety of data about the Universe. The level starts from elementary notions, without assuming any previous knowledge of statis-tical methods, and then progresses to more advanced, research-level topics. After an introduction to the importance of statistical inference for the physical sciences, el-ementary notions of probability theory and inference are introduced and explained. Bayesian methods are then presented, starting from the meaning of Bayes Theo-rem and its use as inferential engine, including a discussion on priors and posterior distributions. Numerical methods for generating samples from arbitrary posteriors (including Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Nested Sampling) are then covered. The last section deals with the topic of Bayesian model selection and how it is used to assess the performance of models, and contrasts it with the classical p-value ap-proach. A series of exercises of various levels of difficulty are designed to further the understanding of the theoretical material, including fully worked out solutions for most of them.},

  abstract = {Halo-based models have been successful in predicting the clustering of matter. How- ever, the validity of the postulate that the clustering is fully determined by matter inside haloes remains largely untested, and it is not clear a priori whether non-virialised matter might contribute significantly to the non-linear clustering signal. Here, we in- vestigate the contribution of haloes to the matter power spectrum as a function of both scale and halo mass by combining a set of cosmological N-body simulations to calculate the contributions of different spherical overdensity regions, Friends-of- Friends (FoF) groups and matter outside haloes to the power spectrum. We find that matter inside spherical overdensity regions of size R200,mean cannot account for all power for 1 ? k ? 100 hMpc-1, regardless of the minimum halo mass. At most, it accounts for 95\% of the power (k ? 20 hMpc-1). For 2 ? k ? 10 hMpc-1, haloes with mass M200,mean ? 1011 h-1M{$\odot$} contribute negligibly to the power spectrum, and our results appear to be converged with decreasing halo mass. When haloes are taken to be regions of size R200,crit, the amount of power unaccounted for is larger on all scales. Accounting also for matter inside FoF groups but outside R200,mean increases the contribution of halo matter on most scales probed here by 5 - 15\%. Matter in- side FoF groups with M200,mean {$>$} 109 h-1M{$\odot$} accounts for essentially all power for 3 {$<$} k {$<$} 100 hMpc-1. We therefore expect halo models that ignore the contribution of matter outside R200,mean to overestimate the contribution of haloes of any mass to the power on small scales (k ? 1 hMpc-1).},

This allows measured correlations to be used as constraints in a Monte Carlo Markov Chain exploration of the astrophysical and cosmological parameter space. An important part of our scheme is an analytic profile which captures the simulated satellite distribution extremely well out to several halo virial radii. This is essential to reproduce the correlation properties of the full simulation at intermediate separations. As a first application, we use low-redshift clustering and abundance measurements to constrain a recent version of the Munich semi-analytic model. The preferred values of most parameters are consistent with those found previously, with significantly improved constraints and somewhat shifted "best" values for parameters that primarily affect spatial distributions. Our methods allow multi-epoch data on galaxy clustering and abundance to be used as joint constraints on galaxy formation. This may lead to significant constraints on cosmological parameters even after marginalising over galaxy formation physics.},

  abstract = {We present a new method that simultaneously solves for cosmology and galaxy bias on non-linear scales. The method uses the halo model to analytically describe the (non-linear) matter distribution, and the conditional luminosity function (CLF) to specify the halo occupation statistics. For a given choice of cosmological parameters, this model can be used to predict the galaxy luminosity function, as well as the two-point correlation functions of galaxies, and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, both as a function of scale and luminosity. These observables have been reliably measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In this paper, the first in a series, we present the detailed, analytical model, which we test against mock galaxy redshift surveys constructed from high-resolution numerical N-body simulations. We demonstrate that our model, which includes scale dependence of the halo bias and a proper treatment of halo exclusion, reproduces the three-dimensional galaxy-galaxy correlation and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation (which can be projected to predict the observables) with an accuracy better than 10 (in most cases 5) per cent. Ignoring either of these effects, as is often done, results in systematic errors that easily exceed 40 per cent on scales of \texttildelow{} 1 h- 1 Mpc, where the data are typically most accurate. Finally, since the projected correlation functions of galaxies are never obtained by integrating the redshift-space correlation function along the line of sight out to infinity, simply because the data only cover a finite volume, they are still affected by residual redshift-space distortions (RRSDs). Ignoring these, as done in numerous studies in the past, results in systematic errors that easily exceed 20 per cent on large scales (rp {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10 h- 1 Mpc). We show that it is fairly straightforward to correct for these RRSDs, to an accuracy better than \texttildelow{} 2 per cent, using a mildly modified version of the linear Kaiser formalism.},

  abstract = {We have built PRISM, a "Probabilistic Regression Instrument for Simulating Models". PRISM uses the Bayes linear approach and history matching to construct an approximation ('emulator') of any given model, by combining limited model evaluations with advanced regression techniques, covariances and probability calculations. It is designed to easily facilitate and enhance existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by restricting plausible regions and exploring parameter space efficiently. However, PRISM can additionally be used as a standalone alternative to MCMC for model analysis, providing insight into the behavior of complex scientific models. With PRISM, the time spent on evaluating a model is minimized, providing developers with an advanced model analysis for a fraction of the time required by more traditional methods. This paper provides an overview of the different techniques and algorithms that are used within PRISM. We demonstrate the advantage of using the Bayes linear approach over a full Bayesian analysis when analyzing complex models. Our results show how much information can be captured by PRISM and how one can combine it with MCMC methods to significantly speed up calibration processes ({$>$}15 times faster).

  abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

We use recent cosmological observations and Bayesian model averaging to derive tight limits on the curvature parameter, as well as robust lower bounds on the curvature radius of the Universe and its minimum size, while allowing for the possibility of an evolving dark energy component. Because flat models are favoured by Bayesian model selection, we find that model-averaged constraints on the curvature and size of the Universe can be considerably stronger than non-model-averaged ones. For the most conservative prior choice (based on inflationary considerations), our procedure improves on non-model-averaged constraints on the curvature by a factor of \texttildelow 2. The curvature scale of the Universe is conservatively constrained to be Rc {$>$} 42 Gpc (99 per cent), corresponding to a lower limit to the number of Hubble spheres in the Universe NU {$>$} 251 (99 per cent).},

  abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between pair counts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR, and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model-independent estimator. Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT, and N-body), we obtain a 20-25\% gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and {$\Lambda$}CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15\% improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter {$\Omega$}m and dark energy {$\Omega\Lambda$} in an open {$\Lambda$}CDM model. The constraints derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large and has a density that is three times higher.},

  abstract = {Tomography of redshifted 21 cm transition from neutral hydrogen using  Fourier synthesis telescopes is a promising tool to study the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Limiting the confusion from Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds is critical to the success of these telescopes. The instrumental response or the point-spread function (PSF) of such telescopes is inherently three dimensional with frequency mapping to the line-of-sight (LOS) distance. EoR signals will necessarily have to be detected in data where continuum confusion persists; therefore, it is important that the PSF has acceptable frequency structure so that the residual foreground does not confuse the EoR signature. This paper aims to understand the three-dimensional PSF and foreground contamination in the same framework. We develop a formalism to estimate the foreground contamination along frequency, or equivalently LOS dimension, and establish a relationship between foreground contamination in the image plane and visibility weights on the Fourier plane. We identify two dominant sources of LOS foreground contamination\textemdash "PSF contamination" and "gridding contamination." We show that PSF contamination is localized in LOS wavenumber space, beyond which there potentially exists an "EoR window" with negligible foreground contamination where we may focus our efforts to detect EoR. PSF contamination in this window may be substantially reduced by judicious choice of a frequency window function. Gridding and imaging algorithms create additional gridding contamination and we propose a new imaging algorithm using the Chirp Z Transform that significantly reduces this contamination. Finally, we demonstrate the analytical relationships and the merit of the new imaging algorithm for the case of imaging with the Murchison Widefield Array.},

  abstract = {We use the high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations from the Aquarius project to investigate in detail the mechanisms that determine the shape of Milky Way type dark matter haloes. We find that, when measured at the instantaneous virial radius, the shape of individual haloes changes with time, evolving from a typically prolate configuration at early stages to a more triaxial/oblate geometry at the present day. This evolution in halo shape correlates well with the distribution of the infalling material: prolate configurations arise when haloes are fed through narrow filaments, which characterizes the early epochs of halo assembly, whereas triaxial/oblate configurations result as the accretion turns more isotropic at later times. Interestingly, at redshift z= 0, clear imprints of the past history of each halo are recorded in their shapes at different radii, which also exhibit a variation from prolate in the inner regions to triaxial/oblate in the outskirts. Provided that the Aquarius haloes are fair representatives of Milky Way like 1012 Msun objects, we conclude that the shape of such dark matter haloes is a complex, time-dependent property, with each radial shell retaining memory of the conditions at the time of collapse.},

  abstract = {We give an analytical form for the weighted correlation function of peaks in a Gaussian random field. In a cosmological context, this approach strictly describes the formation bias and is the main result here. Nevertheless, we show its validity and applicability to the evolved cosmological density field and halo field, using Gaussian random field realisations and dark matter N-body numerical simulations. Using this result from peak theory we compute the bias of peaks (and dark matter halos) and show that it reproduces results from the simulations at the \$\{\textbackslash mathcal O\}(10\textbackslash\%)\$ level. Our analytical formula for the bias predicts a scale-dependent bias with two characteristics: a broad band shape which, however, is most affected by the choice of weighting scheme and evolution bias, and a more robust, narrow feature localised at the BAO scale, an effect that is confirmed in simulations. This scale-dependent bias smooths the BAO feature but, conveniently, does not move it. We provide a simple analytic formula to describe this effect. We envision that our analytic solution will be of use for galaxy surveys that exploit galaxy clustering.},

About 80\% percent of the baryons at z{$>$}2 are believed to reside in the filamentary structures probed by the absorptions. These intergalactic structures trace the underlying dark matter density field at scales and redshifts which cannot be probed by any other observable. After describing the essential physical aspects and a brief historical introduction, I will describe the first analytical models of the Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest in the framework of cold dark matter scenarios. Then, I will focus on possible ways of extracting cosmological parameters from a set of observed quasar spectra, by running a grid of cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations. In particular, I will recover the linear dark matter power spectrum at z{$>$}2 and at scales of \texttildelow 1-40 comoving Mpc. I will address the significance of the results obtained especially when combined with the larger scales measurement of the power spectrum made by WMAP, giving constraints on the power spectrum amplitude, spectral index and its running. I will critically compare all the results obtained with those of the SDSS collaboration, based on a set of more than 3000 quasars at low resolution. Several physical aspects, which could affect the constraints on cosmological parameters, will be briefly discussed: feedback effects in the form of galactic winds, metal enrichment, the thermal state of the intergalactic medium and the amplitude and nature of the ultraviolet background. Finally, I will address further improvements that could be achieved in the next few years in this field both under the observational and the theoretical sides. In particular, the perspectives of measuring the cosmic expansion using absorption lines.},

We utilize a new suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that explore WDM masses of 1, 2 and 4 keV (assuming the WDM consists of thermal relics), along with different physically motivated thermal histories. We carefully address different sources of systematic error that may affect our final results and perform an analysis of the Lyman-{$\alpha$} flux power with conservative error estimates. By using a method that samples the multidimensional astrophysical and cosmological parameter space, we obtain a lower limit mWDM{$\greaterequivlnt$}3.3keV (2{$\sigma$}) for warm dark matter particles in the form of early decoupled thermal relics. Adding the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Lyman-{$\alpha$} flux power spectrum does not improve this limit. Thermal relics of masses 1, 2 and 2.5 keV are disfavored by the data at about the 9{$\sigma$}, 4{$\sigma$} and 3{$\sigma$} C.L., respectively. Our analysis disfavors WDM models where there is a suppression in the linear matter power spectrum at (nonlinear) scales corresponding to k=10h/Mpc which deviates more than 10\% from a Lambda cold dark matter model. Given this limit, the corresponding ``free-streaming mass'' below which the mass function may be suppressed is \texttildelow 2\texttimes 108h-1M{$\odot$}.

  abstract = {We present a catalog of 203 clusters of galaxies serendipitously detected in 647 ROSAT PSPC high Galactic latitude pointings covering 158 deg2. This is one of the largest X-ray-selected cluster samples, comparable in size only to the ROSAT All-Sky Survey sample of nearby clusters (Ebeling et al. 1997). We detect clusters in the inner 17.5 arcmin of the ROSAT PSPC field of view using the spatial extent of their X-ray emission. Fluxes of detected clusters range from 1.6 \texttimes{} 10-14 to 8 \texttimes{} 10-12 ergs s-1 cm-2 in the 0.5-2 keV energy band. X-ray luminosities range from 1042 ergs s-1, corresponding to very poor groups, to \textasciitilde 5 \texttimes{} 1044 ergs s-1, corresponding to rich clusters. The cluster redshifts range from z = 0.015 to z {$>$} 0.5. The catalog lists X-ray fluxes, core radii, and spectroscopic redshifts for 73 clusters and photometric redshifts for the remainder. Our detection method, optimized for finding extended sources in the presence of source confusion, is described in detail. Selection effects necessary for a statistical analysis of the cluster sample are comprehensively studied by Monte Carlo simulations. We have optically confirmed 203 of 223 X-ray sources as clusters of galaxies. Of the remaining 20 sources, 19 are likely false detections arising from blends of unresolved point X-ray sources. Optical identifications of the remaining object are hampered by a bright nearby star. Above a flux of 2 \texttimes{} 10-13 ergs s-1 cm-2, 98\% of extended X-ray sources are optically confirmed clusters. The number of false detections and their flux distribution are in perfect agreement with simulations. The log N-log S relation for clusters derived from our catalog shows excellent agreement with counts of bright clusters derived from the Einstein Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey and ROSAT All-Sky Survey. At fainter fluxes, our log N-log S relation agrees with the smaller area WARPS survey. Our cluster counts appear to be systematically higher than those from a 50 deg2 survey by Rosati et al. In particular, at a flux of 2 \texttimes{} 10-13 ergs s-1 cm-2, we find a surface density of clusters of 0.57 +/- 0.07 deg-2, which is a factor of 1.3 more than was found by Rosati et al. This difference is marginally significant at the \textasciitilde 2 {$\sigma$} level. The large area of our survey makes it possible to study the evolution of the X-ray luminosity function in the high luminosity range inaccessible with other, smaller area ROSAT surveys. Optical observations reported here were obtained at the Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona, at the ESO 3.6 m and Danish 1.54 m telescopes at La Silla, and at the FLWO 1.2 m telescope.},

  abstract = {The most successful cosmological models to date envision structure formation as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly drawing lumps of matter together to form increasingly larger structures. Clusters of galaxies currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest objects that have had time to collapse under the influence of their own gravity. Thus their appearance on the cosmic scene is also relatively recent. Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest things whose masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest objects to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial equilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to determine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of  1014 1015 M{$\odot$} , and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with the mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of structure formation, placing important constraints on cosmological models. Second, clusters are essentially ``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous matter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active galactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a wealth of information about the processes associated with galaxy formation, including the efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects of the resulting feedback processes on galaxy formation. This article reviews our theoretical understanding of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic component of clusters, providing a context for interpreting the flood of new cluster observations that are now arriving from the latest generation of x-ray observatories, large optical surveys, and measurements of cluster-induced distortions in the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.},

  abstract = {Central Galaxies (CGs) in massive halos live in unique environments with formation histories closely linked to that of the host halo. In local clusters they have larger sizes (\$R\_e\$) and lower velocity dispersions (sigma) at fixed stellar mass M\_star, and much larger R\_e at a fixed \$\textbackslash sigma\$ than field and satellite galaxies (non-CGs). Using spectroscopic observations of group galaxies selected from the COSMOS survey, we compare the dynamical scaling relations of early-type CGs and non-CGs at z\textasciitilde 0.6, to distinguish possible mechanisms that produce the required evolution. CGs are systematically offset towards larger R\_e at fixed \$\textbackslash sigma\$ compared to non-CGs with similar M\_star. The CG R\_e-M\_star relation also shows differences, primarily driven by a sub-population (\textasciitilde 15\%) of galaxies with large \$R\_e\$, while the M\_star-sigma relations are indistinguishable. These results are accentuated when double Sersic profiles, which better fit light in the outer regions of galaxies, are adopted. They suggest that even group-scale CGs can develop extended components by these redshifts that can increase total \$R\_e\$ and M\_star estimates by factors of \textasciitilde 2. To probe the evolutionary link between our sample and cluster CGs, we also analyze two cluster samples at z\textasciitilde 0.6 and z\textasciitilde 0. We find similar results for the more massive halos at comparable z, but much more distinct CG scaling relations at low-z. Thus, the rapid, late-time accretion of outer components, perhaps via the stripping and accretion of satellites, would appear to be a key feature that distinguishes the evolutionary history of CGs.},

We study the spatial two-point auto-correlation function in both redshift-space and real-space of a combined sample of over 10,000 LRGs, which represent the most massive galaxies in the universe with stellar masses {$>$} 10\^11 h\^-1 M\_sun and space densities 10\^-4 h\^-3 Mpc\^-3.

We compare our measurements with the predicted evolution of dark matter clustering and use the halo model to interpret our results. We find that our clustering measurements are inconsistent ({$>$}99.9\% significance) with a passive model whereby the LRGs do not merge with one another; a model with a merger rate of 7.5 +/- 2.3\% from z = 0.55 to z = 0.19 (i.e. an average rate of 2.4\% Gyr\^-1) provides a better fit to our observations. Our clustering and number density measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that the merged LRGs were originally central galaxies in different haloes which, following the merger of these haloes, merged to create a single Brightest Cluster Galaxy. In addition, we show that the small-scale clustering signal constrains the scatter in halo merger histories. When combined with measurements of the luminosity function, our results suggest that this scatter is sub-Poisson. While this is a generic prediction of hierarchical models, it has not been tested before.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the clustering of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass at 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 2 using data from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey (NMBS). The precise photometric redshifts and stellar masses that the NMBS produces allow us to define a series of stellar mass limited samples of galaxies more massive than 7 \texttimes{} 109 M sun, 1 \texttimes{} 1010 M sun, and 3 \texttimes{} 1010 M sun in three redshift intervals centered on z = 1.1, 1.5, and 1.9, respectively. In each redshift interval, we show that there exists a strong dependence of clustering strength on the stellar mass limit of the sample, with more massive galaxies showing a higher clustering amplitude on all scales. We further interpret our clustering measurements in the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological context using the halo model of galaxy clustering. We show that the typical halo mass of both central and satellite galaxies increases with stellar mass, whereas the satellite fraction decreases with stellar mass, qualitatively the same as is seen at z {$<$} 1. We see little evidence of any redshift dependence in the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass over our narrow redshift range. However, when we compare our measurements with similar ones at z \textasciitilde = 0, we see clear evidence for a change in this relation. If we assume a universal baryon fraction, the ratio of stellar mass to halo mass reveals the fraction of baryons that have been converted to stars. We see that the peak in this star formation efficiency for central galaxies shifts to higher halo masses at higher redshift, moving from sime7 \texttimes{} 1011 h -1 M sun at z \textasciitilde = 0 to sime3 \texttimes{} 1012 h -1 M sun at z \textasciitilde = 1.5, revealing evidence of "halo downsizing." Finally, we show that for highly biased galaxy populations at z{$>$}1 there may be a discrepancy between the space density and clustering predicted by the halo model and the measured clustering and space density. This could imply that there is a problem with one or more ingredient of the halo model at these redshifts, for instance, the halo bias relation may not yet be precisely calibrated at high halo masses or galaxies may not be distributed within halos following a Navarro-Frenk-White profile.},

We study how discreteness noise influences the growth of non-linear structures smaller than this coherence scale in N-body simulations of cosmic structure formation. It has been known for 20 yr that HDM simulations in which the initial uniform particle load is a cubic lattice exhibit artefacts related to this lattice. In particular, the filaments which form in such simulations break up into regularly spaced clumps which reflect the initial grid pattern. We demonstrate that a similar artefact is present even when the initial uniform particle load is not a lattice, but rather a glass with no preferred directions and no long-range coherence. Such regular fragmentation also occurs in simulations of the collapse of idealized, uniform filaments, although not in simulations of the collapse of infinite uniform sheets. In HDM or WDM simulations all self-bound non-linear structures with masses much smaller than the free streaming mass appear to originate through spurious fragmentation of filaments. These artificial fragments form below a characteristic mass which scales as m1/3pk-2peak, where mp is the N-body particle mass and kpeak is the wavenumber at the maximum of k3P(k)[P(k) is the power spectrum]. This has the unfortunate consequence that the effective mass resolution of such simulations improves only as the cube root of the number of particles employed.},

The projected ellipticity of a group is measured using the moments of the discrete distribution of its member galaxies. We infer the three-dimensional and projected axis ratios of their dark matter haloes by comparing the measured ellipticity distributions with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of projected, triaxial dark matter haloes with different axis ratios. We find that the halo shape has a strong dependence on the halo mass. While the haloes of low-mass groups are nearly spherical, those of massive groups tend to be prolate. For groups containing at least four members, the statistical distribution of their measured ellipticities does not have a strong dependence on the colours of their central galaxies. Our analysis further shows that the average three-dimensional axis ratio for haloes with 12 {$<$} log[M/(h-1Msolar)] {$<$}= 15 is about 1:0.46:0.46, resulting in a projected axis ratio of \textasciitilde 0.77. Our results for the alignment between the orientation of the central galaxy of a group and the distribution of their satellite galaxies are in broad agreement with those obtained by Yang et al. The distribution of satellite galaxies preferentially aligns with the major axis of the central galaxy, with a clear dependence on both halo mass and galaxy colours. In particular, the alignment is stronger in more massive groups, and the strongest alignment is seen between red centrals and the distribution of red satellites. For groups with blue centrals, no significant alignment is detected. Finally, we examine how the observed alignment can be reproduced with the information about the halo axis ratios. The observed alignment signal can be reproduced if the angle between the major axis of the central galaxy and the projected major axis of the host halo has a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0\textdegree{} and a dispersion of \textasciitilde 23\textdegree. This dispersion is larger for groups with blue centrals than those with red centrals.},

The large-scale tidal field estimated from haloes above a mass threshold is used as our primary quantity to characterize the large-scale environment, while other parameters, such as the local overdensity and the morphology of large-scale structure, are used for comparison. For haloes at a fixed mass, all the halo properties depend significantly on environment, particularly the tidal field. The environmental dependence of halo assembly time is primarily driven by local tidal field. The mass of the unbound fraction in substructure is boosted in strong tidal force region, while the bound fraction is suppressed. Haloes have a tendency to spin faster in a stronger tidal field and the trend is stronger for more massive haloes. The spin vectors show significant alignment with the intermediate axis of the tidal field, as expected from the tidal torque theory. Both the major and minor axes of haloes are strongly aligned with the corresponding principal axes of the tidal field. In general, a halo that can accrete more material after the formation of its main halo on average is younger, more elongated, spins faster and contains a larger amount of substructure. Higher-density environments not only provide more material for haloes to accrete, but also are places of stronger tidal fields that tend to suppress halo accretion. The environmental dependencies are the results of these two competing effects. The tidal field based on haloes can be estimated from observation, and we discuss the implications of our results for the environmental dependence of galaxy properties.},

We update the flag criteria to select a clean galaxy catalog and detail specific tests that we perform to characterize systematic effects, including the effects of seeing, Galactic extinction, and the overall survey uniformity. Notably, we find that optimally we can use observed regions with seeing \${$<$} 1\textbackslash farcs5\$, and \$r\$-band extinction {$<$} 0.13 magnitudes, smaller than previously published results. Furthermore, we confirm that the uniformity of the SDSS photometry is minimally affected by the stripe geometry. We find that, overall, the two-point angular correlation function can be described by a power law, \$\textbackslash omega(\textbackslash theta) = A\_\textbackslash omega \textbackslash theta\^\{(1-\textbackslash gamma)\}\$ with \$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash simeq 1.72\$, over the range \$0\textbackslash fdg005\$--\$10\textbackslash degr\$. We also find similar relationships for the four magnitude subsamples, but the amplitude within the same angular interval for the four subsamples is found to decrease with fainter magnitudes, in agreement with previous results. We find that the systematic signals are well below the galaxy angular correlation function for angles less than approximately \$5\textbackslash degr\$, which limits the modeling of galaxy angular correlations on larger scales. Finally, we present our custom, highly parallelized two-point correlation code that we used in this analysis.},

To accomplish this, we use infinitessimal perturbation analysis (IPA) to construct a stochastic gradient estimator and show that this estimator is unbiased. We also show that the stochastic gradient ascent algorithm using the constructed gradient estimator converges to a stationary point of the q-EI surface, and therefore, as the number of multiple starts of the gradient ascent algorithm and the number of steps for each start grow large, the one-step Bayes optimal set of points is recovered. We show in numerical experiments that our method for maximizing the q-EI is faster than methods based on exact evaluation using high-dimensional integration, when considering many parallel function evaluations, and is comparable in speed when considering few. We also show that the resulting one-step Bayes optimal algorithm for parallel global optimization finds high quality solutions with fewer evaluations than a heuristic based on approximately maximizing the q-EI. A high quality open source implementation of this algorithm is available in the open source Metrics Optimization Engine (MOE).},

Using 'Dark Sky', a suite of cosmological \$N\$-body simulations, we investigate how halo concentration evolves with time and emerges from the mass assembly history. We also explore the origin of the scatter in the relation between concentration and assembly history. We show that the evolution of halo concentration has two primary modes: (1) smooth increase due to pseudo-evolution; and (2) intense responses to physical merger events. Merger events induce lasting and substantial changes in halo structures, and we observe a universal response in the concentration parameter. We argue that merger events are a major contributor to the uncertainty in halo concentration at fixed halo mass and formation time. In fact, even haloes that are typically classified as having quiescent formation histories experience multiple minor mergers. These minor mergers drive small deviations from pseudo-evolution, which cause fluctuations in the concentration parameters and result in effectively irreducible scatter in the relation between concentration and assembly history. Hence, caution should be taken when using present-day halo concentration parameter as a proxy for the halo assembly history, especially if the recent merger history is unknown.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the properties of tidally stripped material from disrupting substructure haloes or subhaloes in a sample of high-resolution cosmological N-body host haloes ranging from galaxy- to cluster-mass scales. We focus on devising methods to recover the infall mass and infall eccentricity of subhaloes from the properties of their tidally stripped material (i.e. tidal streams). Our analysis reveals that there is a relation between the scatter of stream particles about the best-fitting debris plane and the infall mass of the progenitor subhalo. This allows us to reconstruct the infall mass from the spread of its tidal debris in space. We also find that the spread in radial velocities of the debris material (as measured by an observer located at the centre of the host) correlates with the infall eccentricity of the subhalo, which allows us to reconstruct its orbital parameters. We devise an automated method to identify the leading and trailing arms that can, in principle at least, be applied to observations of stellar streams from satellite galaxies. This method is based on the energy distribution of material in the tidal stream. Using this method, we show that the masses associated with the leading and trailing arms differ. While our analysis indicates that tidal streams can be used to recover certain properties of their progenitor subhaloes (and consequently satellites), we do not find strong correlations between host halo properties and stream properties. This likely reflects the complicated relationship between the stream and the host, which in a cosmological context is characterized by a complex mass accretion history, an asymmetric mass distribution and the abundance of substructure. Finally, we confirm that the so-called `backsplash' subhalo population is present not only in galaxy cluster haloes but also in galaxy haloes. The orbits of backsplash subhaloes brought them inside the virial radius of their host at some earlier time, but they now reside in its outskirts at the present-day, beyond the virial radius. Both backsplash and bound subhaloes experience similar mass loss, but the contribution of the backsplash subhaloes to the overall tidal debris field is negligible.},

We consider sinks in both the intergalactic medium and inside galaxies. At a fixed filling factor of H II regions, sinks will have two main effects on the 21-cm morphology: (i) as inhomogeneous absorbers of ionizing photons they result in smaller and more widespread cosmic H II patches; and (ii) as reservoirs of neutral gas they contribute a non-zero 21-cm signal in otherwise ionized regions. Both effects damp the contrast between neutral and ionized patches during reionization, making detection of the epoch of reionization with 21-cm interferometry more challenging. Here we systematically investigate these effects using the latest seminumerical simulations. We find that sinks dramatically suppress the peak in the redshift evolution of the variance, corresponding to the mid-point of reionization. As previously predicted, skewness changes sign at mid-point, but the fluctuations in the residual H I suppress a late-time rise. Furthermore, large levels of residual H I dramatically alter the evolution of the variance, skewness and power spectrum from that seen at lower levels. In general, the evolution of the large-scale modes provides a better, cleaner, higher signal-to-noise probe of reionization.},

Wouthuysen-Field coupling is assumed to be saturated and ionizations are negligible, we therefore probe the nature of non-Gaussianities produced by X-ray heating processes. We find the evolution of the normalised bispectrum to be very different from that of the power spectrum. It exhibits a turnover whose peak moves from large to small scales with decreasing redshift, corresponding to the typical separation of emission regions. This characteristic scale reduces as more and more regions move into emission with time. Ultimately, small-scale fluctuations within heated regions come to dominate the normalised bispectrum, which at the end of the simulation is driven by fluctuations in the density field. To establish how generic the qualitative evolution of the normalised bispectrum we see in the stellar + HMXB simulation is, we examine several other simulations - two fully-numerical simulations that include QSO sources, and two with contrasting source properties produced with the semi-numerical simulation 21cmFAST. We find the qualitative evolution of the normalised bispectrum during X-ray heating to be generic, unless the sources of X-rays are, as with QSOs, less numerous and so exhibit more distinct isolated heated profiles. Assuming mitigation of foreground and instrumental effects are ultimately effective, we find that we should be sensitive to the normalised bispectrum during the epoch of heating, so long as the spin temperature has not saturated by \$z \textbackslash approx 19\$.},

  abstract = {We study the relation between the density profiles of dark matter halos and their mass assembly histories using a statistical sample of halos in a high-resolution N-body simulation of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. For each halo at z=0, we identify its merger history tree and determine concentration parameters cvir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree for each halo. We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with one parameter, the formation epoch ac, defined when the log mass accretion rate dlogM/dloga falls below a critical value S. We find that late-forming galaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that cvir ``observed'' at any epoch ao is strongly correlated with ac via cvir=c1ao/ac. Scatter about this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in cvir and ac, implying that the actual spread in cvir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed to scatter in ac. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of cvir and the scatter about the median cvir(M,z) using accretion histories derived from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset between the formation times as predicted by EPS and as measured in the simulations; this new ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The correlation found between halo concentration and mass accretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates, the central density is related to the background density; when the mass infall rate slows, the central density stays approximately constant, and the halo concentration just grows as Rvir. Because of the direct connection between halo concentration and velocity rotation curves and because of probable connections between halo mass assembly history and star formation history, the tight correlation between these properties provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.},

We confirm results that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time at fixed mass and that this trend depends on halo mass. For the first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately parameterized in a simple way: b(M,c|z)=b(M|z)bcvir(c|M/M*). Interestingly, the scaling between bias and concentration changes sign with the value of M/M*: high-concentration (early forming) objects cluster more strongly for M{$<\sptilde$}M*, while low-concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-mass halos, M{$>\sptilde$}M*. We show the first explicit demonstration that host dark halo clustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) at fixed mass and discuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g., low surface brightness dwarfs) should have more slowly rising rotation curves than their more clustered counterparts and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that self-calibrating richness-selected cluster samples with their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias cosmological parameter estimation.},

  abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of "dark energy" with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimental efforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit "Stage IV" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski test, and direct measurements of H\_0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from GR, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and CMB data. We also show the level of precision required for other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

Such modifications would be expected to alter the formation of structure from bottom-up to top-down on scales near where the short-scale power has been suppressed. Using cosmological simulations we study the effects of such a modification of the initial power spectrum. While the halo multiplicity function depends primarily on the linear theory power spectrum, most other probes of power are more sensitive to the non-linear power spectrum. Collapse of large-scale structures as they go non-linear regenerates a ``tail'' in the power spectrum, masking small-scale modifications to the primordial power spectrum except at very high-z. Even the small-scale (k{$>$}2h/Mpc) clustering of the Ly-alpha forest is affected by this process, so that CDM models with sufficient power suppression to reduce the number of 10\^10 Msun halos by a factor of about 5 give similar Ly-alpha forest power spectrum results. We conclude that other observations that depend more directly on the number density of collapsed objects, such as the number of damped Ly-alpha systems, or the redshift of reionization may provide the most sensitive tests of these models.},

  abstract = {The reionization of hydrogen is closely linked to the first structures in the universe, so understanding the timeline of cosmic reionization promises to shed light on the nature of these early objects. In particular, transmission of Lyman alpha (Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$) from galaxies through the intergalactic medium (IGM) is sensitive to neutral hydrogen in the IGM, so can be used to probe the reionization timeline. In this work, we implement an improved model of the galaxy UV luminosity to dark matter halo mass relation to infer the volume-averaged fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM from Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ observations. Many models assume that UV-bright galaxies are hosted by massive dark matter haloes in overdense regions of the IGM, and thus reside in relatively large ionized regions. However, observations and N-body simulations indicate that scatter in the UV luminosity-halo mass relation is expected. Here, we model the scatter and assess the impact on Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ visibility during reionization. We show that UV luminosity-halo mass scatter tends to reduce Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ visibility compared to models without scatter, and that this is most significant for UV-bright galaxies. We then use our model to infer the neutral fraction, \$\textbackslash overline\{x\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{HI\}\}\$, at \$z \textbackslash sim 7\$ using a sample of Lyman-break galaxies in legacy fields, updating the neutral fraction inference performed without accounting for scatter; we find \$\textbackslash overline\{x\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{HI\}\} = 0.55\_\{-0.13\}\^\{+0.11\}\$ with scatter, a slight decrease from the neutral fraction inferred without scatter, \$\textbackslash overline\{x\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{HI\}\} = 0.59\_\{-0.14\}\^\{+0.12\}\$. Finally, we discuss implications for future high-redshift galaxy studies. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

The line correlation function, which is constructed from the three-point correlation function of the phase of the density field, is a robust statistical measure allowing the extraction of information in the non-linear and non-Gaussian regime. We show that, in perturbation theory, the line correlation is sensitive to the coupling kernel F\_2, which governs the non-linear gravitational evolution of the density field. We compare our analytical expression with results from numerical simulations and find a very good agreement for separations r{$>$}20 Mpc/h. Fitting formulae for the power spectrum and the non-linear coupling kernel at small scales allow us to extend our prediction into the strongly non-linear regime. We discuss the advantages of the line correlation relative to standard statistical measures like the bispectrum. Unlike the latter, the line correlation is independent of the linear bias. Furthermore, the variance of the line correlation is independent of the Gaussian variance on the modulus of the density field. This suggests that the line correlation can probe more precisely the non-linear regime of gravity, with less contamination from the power spectrum variance.},

We show that the H\,i-galaxy cross-power spectrum contains an additive shot noise term that scales with the average H\,i brightness temperature of the optically selected galaxies, allowing constraints to be placed on the average H\,i mass per galaxy. This approach can estimate the H\,i content of populations too faint to directly observe through their 21-cm emission over a wide range of redshifts. This cross-correlation, as a function of optical luminosity or colour, can be used to derive H\,i-scaling relations. We demonstrate that this signal will be detectable by cross-correlating upcoming Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder observations with existing optically selected samples. We also use semi-analytic simulations to verify that the H\,i mass can be successfully recovered by our technique in the range \$\$M\_\{\textbackslash rm H\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash small I\}\} \&gt; 10\^8 \textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\$\$, in a manner independent of the underlying power spectrum shape.

Cross-correlation of the intensity maps with optical galaxy surveys can mitigate foreground and systematic effects, but has been shown to significantly depend on galaxy evolution parameters of the H I and the optical sample. Previously, we have shown that the shot noise of the cross-correlation scales with the H I content of the optical samples, such that the shot noise estimation infers the average H I masses of these samples. In this paper, we present an adaptive framework for the cross-correlation of H I intensity maps with galaxy samples using our implementation of the halo model formalism which utilizes the halo occupation distribution of galaxies to predict their power spectra. We compare two H I population models, tracing the spatial halo and the galaxy distribution, respectively, and present their auto- and cross-power spectra with an associated galaxy sample. We find that the choice of the H I model and the distribution of the H I within the galaxy sample have little impact for the shape of the auto- and cross-correlations, but significantly affects the measured shot noise amplitude of the estimators, a finding we confirm with simulations. We demonstrate parameter estimation of the H I halo occupation models and advocate this framework for the interpretation of future experimental data, with the prospect of determining the H I masses of optical galaxy samples via the cross-correlation shot noise.},

For ellipticals of fixed stellar mass, the radio power is not a function of large-scale environment nor halo mass, consistent with the radio powers of ellipticals varying by orders of magnitude over billions of years.},

The resulting parameter constraints describe properties like gas richness verses environment. Unfortunately, clustering studies based on individual HI galaxies will be restricted to the local Universe for the foreseeable future, even with the deepest HI surveys. Here we discuss how clustering studies of the HI HOD could be extended to moderate redshift, through observations of fluctuations in the combined 21cm intensity of unresolved galaxies. In particular we make an analytic estimate for the clustering of HI in the HOD. Our joint goals are to estimate i) the amplitude of the signal, and ii) the sensitivity of telescopes like the Australian SKA Pathfinder to HOD parameters. We find that the power spectrum of redshifted 21cm intensity could be used to study the distribution of HI within dark matter halos at z{$>$}0.5 where individual galaxies cannot be detected. In addition to the HOD of HI, the amplitude of the 21cm power spectrum would also yield estimates of the cosmic HI content at epochs between the local Universe, and redshifts probed by damped Ly-alpha absorbers.},

We obtain a number of stringent constraints on both galaxy formation and cosmology. In particular, this method can break the degeneracy between Omega\_0 and the power-spectrum normalization sigma\_8, inherent in current weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. For flat LCDM cosmogonies with sigma\_8 normalized by recent weak lensing observations, the best results are obtained for Omega\_0\textasciitilde 0.3; Omega\_0 {$<$} 0.2 leads to too large galaxy correlation lengths, while Omega\_0 {$>$} 0.4 gives too high M/L. The best-fit model for the LCDM concordance cosmology (Omega\_0=0.3) predicts M/L that are slightly too high. We discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy this problem, including small modification of cosmological parameters, warm in stead of cold dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and the existence of dark galaxies. Finally we use the CLF to predict several statistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local Universe.},

The occupation distribution is considered separately for early and late type galaxies, as well as in terms of central and satellite galaxies. The mean luminosity of the central galaxies scales with halo mass approximately as \$L\_c\textbackslash propto M\^\{2/3\}\$ for haloes with masses \$M{$<$}10\^\{13\}h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash msun\$, and as \$L\_c\textbackslash propto M\^\{1/4\}\$ for more massive haloes. The characteristic mass of \$10\^\{13\} h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash Msun\$ is consistent with the mass scale where galaxy formation models suggest a transition from efficient to inefficient cooling. Another characteristic halo mass scale, \$M\textbackslash sim 10\^\{11\} h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash msun\$, which cannot be probed directly by our groups, is inferred from the conditional luminosity function (CLF) that matches the observed galaxy luminosity function and clustering. For a halo of given mass, the distribution of \$L\_c\$ is rather narrow. The satellite galaxies are found to follow a Poissonian number distribution. The central galaxies in low-mass haloes are mostly late type galaxies, while those in massive haloes are almost all early types. We also measure the CLF of galaxies in haloes of given mass. Over the mass range that can be reliably probed with the present data (\$13.3 \textbackslash lta \{\textbackslash rm log\}[M/(h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash Msun)] \textbackslash lta 14.7\$), the CLF is reasonably well fit by a Schechter function. Contrary to recent claims based on semi-analytical models of galaxy formation, the presence of central galaxies does not show up as a strong peak at the bright end of the CLF. (Abridged)},

In order to avoid systematic biases and reduce uncertainties, we study the form and physical origin of the intrinsic scatter about the mean Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) flux-mass relation using a hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy cluster formation. We examine the assumption of lognormal scatter and detect non-negligible positive skewness and kurtosis ({$>$}0.5) for a wide range of limiting masses and redshifts. These higher order moments should be included in the parameterization of scatter in order not to bias cosmological constraints. We investigate the sources of the scatter by correlating it with measures of cluster morphology, halo concentration, and dynamical state, and quantify the individual contribution from each source. We find that statistically the impact of the dynamical state is weak, so the selection bias due to mergers is negligible. On the other hand, there is a strong correlation between the scatter and halo concentration, which can be used to reduce the scatter significantly (from 12.07\% to 7.34\% or by \textasciitilde 40\% for clusters at z = 0). We also show that a cross-calibration by combining information from X-ray follow-ups can be used to reduce the scatter in the flux-mass relation and also identify outliers in both X-ray and SZ cluster surveys.},

  abstract = {Aims: The aim of the LOFAR epoch of reionization (EoR) project is  to detect the spectral fluctuations of the redshifted HI 21 cm signal. This signal is weaker by several orders of magnitude than the astrophysical foreground signals and hence, in order to achieve this, very long integrations, accurate calibration for stations and ionosphere and reliable foreground removal are essential. Methods: One of the prospective observing windows for the LOFAR EoR project will be centered at the north celestial pole (NCP). We present results from observations of the NCP window using the LOFAR highband antenna (HBA) array in the frequency range 115 MHz to 163 MHz. The data were obtained in April 2011 during the commissioning phase of LOFAR. We used baselines up to about 30 km. The data was processed using a dedicated processing pipeline which is an enhanced version of the standard LOFAR processing pipeline. Results: With about 3 nights, of 6 h each, effective integration we have achieved a noise level of about 100 {$\mu$}Jy/PSF in the NCP window. Close to the NCP, the noise level increases to about 180 {$\mu$}Jy/PSF, mainly due to additional contamination from unsubtracted nearby sources. We estimate that in our best night, we have reached a noise level only a factor of 1.4 above the thermal limit set by the noise from our Galaxy and the receivers. Our continuum images are several times deeper than have been achieved previously using the WSRT and GMRT arrays. We derive an analytical explanation for the excess noise that we believe to be mainly due to sources at large angular separation from the NCP. We present some details of the data processing challenges and how we solved them. Conclusions: Although many LOFAR stations were, at the time of the observations, in a still poorly calibrated state we have seen no artefacts in our images which would prevent us from producing deeper images in much longer integrations on the NCP window which are about to commence. The limitations present in our current results are mainly due to sidelobe noise from the large number of distant sources, as well as errors related to station beam variations and rapid ionospheric phase fluctuations acting on bright sources. We are confident that we can improve our results with refined processing.},

We compare evolution when CDM mean free paths are comparable to halo sizes with the collisionless and fluid limits. We show that a few collisions per particle per Hubble time at halo center can substantially affect the central density profile. Cross sections an order of magnitude larger produce sufficient relaxation for rich clusters to develop core radii in the range 100-200 h-1 kpc. The structural evolution of halos is a competition between collisional relaxation caused by individual particle interactions and violent relaxation resulting from the infall and merging processes by which clusters grow. Although our simulations concentrate on systems of cluster size, we can scale our results to address the halo structure expected for dwarf galaxies. We find that collision cross sections sufficiently large to significantly modify the cores of such galaxies produce cluster cores that are too large and/or too round to be consistent with observation. Thus, the simplest model for self-interacting dark matter is unable to improve fits to published dwarf galaxy rotation curves without violating other observational constraints.},

  abstract = {We constrain the contribution of high-\$z\$ galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to reionization, by comparing numerically computed H/He reionization with the observed HI/HeII fractions at various redshifts and optical depth to Thomson scattering. In the model, the contribution of galaxies is controlled by a parameter \$f\_\{\textbackslash rm esc\}\$ which indicates the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the galaxies, adopting an observed cosmic star formation history. On the other hand, in order to take ionizing photons from ANGs into account, observed X-ray luminosity functions and a composite spectral energy density with the energies in the range of \$13.6\textbackslash rm eV\$ to \$100\textbackslash rm keV\$ are assumed at \$z\textbackslash leq3\$, while the redshift evolution of AGN abundance at \$z{$>$}3\$ is assumed to be proportional to \$(1+z)\^\textbackslash beta\$, where \$\textbackslash beta\$ is a parameter in the model. We find that there are observationally allowed sets of the parameters \$f\_\{\textbackslash rm esc\}\$ and \$\textbackslash beta\$. According to the comparisons, \$\textbackslash beta\$ should satisfy \$-4.2{$<\backslash$}beta{$<$}-1.5\$ with \$0.1{$<$} f\_\{\textbackslash rm esc\}{$<$}0.18\$, otherwise the model fails to complete the He\{II\} reionization by \$z\textbackslash approx3\$. High escape fractions of \$f\_\{\textbackslash rm esc\}{$>$}0.18\$ are also unfavorable, because employing such high values results in early H\{I\} reionization. Interestingly even if we adopt \$f\_\{\textbackslash rm esc\}{$<$}0.01\$, the observed H\{I\}/He\{II\} fractions can be reproduced by numerical results with \$\textbackslash beta\textbackslash approx-1\$ as similar to the "AGN-dominated scenario" reported by Madau \textbackslash\& Haardt (2015). Such a high abundance of AGNs could be achieved if there were numbers of undiscovered faint AGNs during the EoR. We also confirm whether or not measurements of X-ray Background (XRB) is available for a constraint on AGN abundance during the EoR, and conclude that XRB is possibly difficult to use for the constraint, because the contribution of AGNs at \$z{$>$}3\$ is too small to be distinguished.},

  abstract = {Cross-correlation between the redshifted 21\$\textbackslash,\$cm signal and Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) is powerful tool to probe the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Although the cross-power spectrum (PS) has an advantage of not correlating with foregrounds much brighter than the 21\$\textbackslash,\$cm signal, the galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds prevent detection since they contribute to the variance of the cross PS. Therefore, strategies for mitigating foregrounds are required. In this work, we study the impact of foreground avoidance on the measurement of the 21\$\textbackslash,\$cm-LAE cross-correlation. We then simulate the 21\$\textbackslash,\$cm observation as observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The point source foreground is modelled from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey catalogue, and the diffuse foreground is evaluated using a parametric model. For LAE observations, we assume a large survey of the Subaru Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC), with spectroscopic observations of the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). To predict the 21\$\textbackslash,\$cm signal, we employ a numerical simulation combining post processed radiative transfer and radiation hydrodynamics. Using these models, the signal-to-noise ratio of 2D PS shows the foreground contamination dominates the error of cross-PS at large scales even in the so-called `EoR window'. We find that at least 95\% of the point source foreground and 80\% of the galactic diffuse foreground must be removed to measure the EoR signal at large scales \$k{$<$}0.2 \textbackslash rm h\textbackslash,Mpc\^\{-1\}\$. Additionally, a sensitivity 16 times larger than that of the MWA operating with 128 tiles and 90\% of the point source foreground removal are required for a detection at small scales.},

The mixture evolution scenario can naturally explain the luminosity dependent evolution of the RLFs.},

  abstract = {Ultra-faint galaxies are hosted by small dark matter halos with shallow  gravitational potential wells, hence their star formation activity is more sensitive to feedback effects. The shape of the faint-end of the high-\$z\$ galaxy luminosity function (LF) contains important information on star formation and its interaction with the reionization process during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). High-\$z\$ galaxies with \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm UV\}\textbackslash gtrsim-17\$ have only recently become accessible thanks to the Frontier Fields (FFs) survey combining deep HST imaging and the gravitational lensing effect. In this paper we investigate the faint-end of the LF at redshift \${$>\$$}5 using the data of FFs clusters Abell 2744 (A2744), MACSJ0416.1-2403 (M0416), MACSJ0717.5+3745 (M0717) and MACSJ1149.5+2223 (M1149). We analyze both an empirical and a physically-motivated LF model to obtain constraints on a possible turn-over of LF at faint magnitudes. In the empirical model the LF drops fast when the absolute UV magnitude \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm UV\}\$ is much larger than a turn-over absolute UV magnitude \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm UV\}\^\{\textbackslash rm T\}\$. We obtain \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm UV\}\^\{\textbackslash rm T\}\textbackslash gtrsim-14.3\$ at 2\$\textbackslash sigma\$ confidence level (C.L.) for \$z\textbackslash sim6\$. In the physically-motivated analytical model, star formation in halos with circular velocity below \$v\_c\^*\$ is fully quenched if these halos are located in ionized regions. Using updated lensing models and new additional FFs data, we re-analyze previous constraints on \$v\_c\^*\$ and \$f\_\{\textbackslash rm esc\}\$ presented by Castellano et al. 2016a (C16a) using a smaller dataset. We obtain new constraints on \$v\_c\^*\textbackslash lesssim 57\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ and \$f\_\{\textbackslash rm esc\}\textbackslash lesssim 63\textbackslash\%\$ (both at 2\$\textbackslash sigma\$ C.L.) and conclude that there is no turn-over detected so far from the analyzed FFs data. Forthcoming JWST observations will be key to tight these constraints further.},

  abstract = {The Universe's dark ages end with the formation of the first generation of galaxies. These objects start emitting ultraviolet radiation that carves out ionized regions around them. After a sufficient number of ionizing sources have formed, the ionized fraction of the gas in the Universe rapidly increases until hydrogen becomes fully ionized. This period, during which the cosmic gas went from neutral to ionized, is known as the Universe's Epoch of Reionization . The Epoch of Reionization is related to many fundamental questions in cosmology, such as properties of the first galaxies, physics of (mini-)quasars, formation of very metal-poor stars and a slew of other important research topics in astrophysics. Hence uncovering it will have far reaching implications on the study of structure formation in the early Universe. This chapter reviews the current observational evidence for the occurrence of this epoch, its key theoretical aspects and main characteristics, and finally the various observational probes that promise to uncover it. A special emphasis is put on the redshifted 21 cm probe, the various experiments that are currently being either built or designed, and what we can learn from them about the Epoch of Reionization.},

  abstract = {The development of methods and algorithms to solve the N-body problem for classical, collisionless, non-relativistic particles has made it possible to follow the growth and evolution of cosmic dark matter structures over most of the Universe's history. In the best studied case \textendash{} the cold dark matter or CDM model \textendash{} the dark matter is assumed to consist of elementary particles that had negligible thermal velocities at early times. Progress over the past three decades has led to a nearly complete description of the assembly, structure and spatial distribution of dark matter haloes, and their substructure in this model, over almost the entire mass range of astronomical objects. On scales of galaxies and above, predictions from this standard CDM model have been shown to provide a remarkably good match to a wide variety of astronomical data over a large range of epochs, from the temperature structure of the cosmic background radiation to the large-scale distribution of galaxies. The frontier in this field has shifted to the relatively unexplored subgalactic scales, the domain of the central regions of massive haloes, and that of low-mass haloes and subhaloes, where potentially fundamental questions remain. Answering them may require: (i) the effect of known but uncertain baryonic processes (involving gas and stars), and/or (ii) alternative models with new dark matter physics. Here we present a review of the field, focusing on our current understanding of dark matter structure from N-body simulations and on the challenges ahead.},

  abstract = {Using a suite of detailed numerical simulations, we estimate the level of anisotropy generated by the time evolution along the light cone of the 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization. Our simulations include the physics necessary to model the signal during both the late emission regime and the early absorption regime, namely X-ray and Lyman band 3D radiative transfer in addition to the usual dynamics and ionizing UV transfer. The signal is analysed using correlation functions perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight. We reproduce general findings from previous theoretical studies: the overall amplitude of the correlations and the fact that the light-cone anisotropy is visible only on large scales (100 comoving Mpc). However, the detailed behaviour is different. We find that, at three different epochs, the amplitudes of the correlations along and perpendicular to the line of sight differ from each other, indicating anisotropy. We show that these three epochs are associated with three events of the global reionization history: the overlap of ionized bubbles, the onset of mild heating by X-rays in regions around the sources, and the onset of efficient Lyman {$\alpha$} coupling in regions around the sources. We find that a 20 \texttimes{} 20 deg2 survey area may be necessary to mitigate sample variance when we use the directional correlation functions. On a 100 Mpc (comoving) scale, we show that the light-cone anisotropy dominates over the anisotropy generated by peculiar velocity gradients computed in the linear regime. By modelling instrumental noise and limited resolution, we find that the anisotropy should be easily detectable by the Square Kilometre Array, assuming perfect foreground removal, the limiting factor being a large enough survey size. In the case of the Low-Frequency Array for radio astronomy, it is likely that only one anisotropy episode (ionized bubble overlap) will fall in the observing frequency range. This episode will be detectable only if sample variance is much reduced (i.e. a larger than 20 \texttimes{} 20 deg2 survey, which is not presently planned).},

Both correlation functions show subtle but systematic departures from the best-fit power law, in particular a change in slope at rp\textasciitilde 1-2 h-1 Mpc. These departures are stronger for the volume-limited sample, which is restricted to relatively luminous galaxies. We show that the inflection point in wp(rp) can be naturally explained by contemporary models of galaxy clustering, according to which it marks the transition from a large-scale regime dominated by galaxy pairs in separate dark matter halos to a small-scale regime dominated by galaxy pairs in the same dark matter halo. For example, given the dark halo population predicted by an inflationary cold dark matter scenario, the projected correlation function of the volume-limited sample can be well reproduced by a model in which the mean number of Mr{$<$}-21 galaxies in a halo of mass M{$>$}M1=4.74\texttimes 1013 h-1 Msolar is M=(M/M1)0.89, with 75\% of the galaxies residing in less massive, single-galaxy halos and simple auxiliary assumptions about the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos and the fluctuations about the mean occupation. This physically motivated model has the same number of free parameters as a power law, and it fits the wp(rp) data better, with a {$\chi$}2/dof=0.93, compared to 6.12 (for 10 degrees of freedom, incorporating the covariance of the correlation function errors). Departures from a power-law correlation function encode information about the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos. Higher precision measurements of these departures for multiple classes of galaxies will constrain galaxy bias and provide new tests of the theory of galaxy formation.},

It is found that using an enclosed integration volume and weight factors r -2 and r -2 ell (elliptical radius) for the contribution of each particle or volume element in the shape tensor leads to biased axis ratios and smoothing of details when calculating the local shape as a function of distance from the center. To determine the local shape of matter distributions as a function of distance for well-resolved objects (typically more than \{O\}(10\^4) particles), we advocate a method that (1) uses an ellipsoidal shell (homoeoid) as an integration volume without any weight factors in the shape tensor and (2) removes subhalos.},

I recount the Press-Schechter argument for the mass function of bound objects and review the derivation of the Press-Schechter mass function in EST. The EST formalism is powerful and can be applied to numerous problems. I review the EST of halo bias and the properties of void regions. I spend considerable time reviewing halo growth in the EST. This section culminates with descriptions of two Monte Carlo methods for generating halo mass accretion histories. In the final section, I emphasize that the standard EST approach is the result of several simplifying assumptions. Dropping these assumptions can lead to more faithful predictions and a more versatile formalism. One such assumption is the constant height of the barrier for nonlinear collapse. I review implementations of the excursion set approach with arbitrary barrier shapes. An application of this is the now well-known improvement to standard EST that follows from the ellipsoidal-collapse barrier. Additionally, I emphasize that the statement that halo accretion histories are independent of halo environments is a simplifying assumption, rather than a prediction of the theory. I review the method for constructing correlated random walks of the density field in more general cases. I construct a simple toy model with correlated walks and I show that excursion set theory makes a qualitatively simple and general prediction for the relation between halo accretion histories and halo environments: regions of high density preferentially contain late-forming halos and conversely for regions of low density. I conclude with a brief discussion of this prediction in the context of recent numerical studies of the environmental dependence of halo properties. (Abridged)},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyse in detail the mass-accretion histories and structural properties of dark haloes in high-resolution N-body simulations. We model the density distribution in individual haloes using the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. For a given halo, there is a tight correlation between its inner-scale radius rs and the mass within it, Ms, for all its main progenitors. Using this correlation, one can predict quite well the structural properties of a dark halo at any time in its history from its mass-accretion history, implying that the structure properties and the mass-accretion history are closely correlated. The predicted growing rate of concentration c with time tends to increase with decreasing mass-accretion rate. The build-up of dark haloes in cold dark matter (CDM) models generally consists of an early phase of fast accretion (where the halo mass Mh increases with time much faster than the expansion rate of the Universe) and a late phase of slow accretion (where Mh increases with time approximately as the expansion rate). These two phases are separated at a time when c\textasciitilde{} 4 and the typical binding energy of the halo is approximately equal to that of a singular isothermal sphere with the same circular velocity. Haloes in the two accretion phases show systematically different properties, for example, the circular velocity vh increases rapidly with time in the fast accretion phase but remains almost constant in the slow accretion phase, the inner properties of a halo, such as rs and Ms increase rapidly with time in the fast accretion phase but change only slowly in the slow accretion phase, the inner circular velocity vs is approximately equal to vh in the fast accretion phase but is larger in the slow accretion phase. The potential well associated with a halo is built up mainly in the fast accretion phase, while a large amount of mass can be accreted in the slow accretion phase without changing the potential well significantly. We discuss our results in connection with the formation of dark haloes and galaxies in hierarchical models.},

Our main results are that the mass dependence of the concentrations becomes weaker at higher redshifts and that at z{$>\sptilde$}3, halos of mass greater than 1011 h-1 Msolar all have a similar median concentration, c\textasciitilde 3.5. While the median concentrations of low-mass halos grow significantly with time, those of massive halos change very little with redshift.

  abstract = {A large amount of observations have constrained cosmological parameters and the initial density fluctuation spectrum to a very high accuracy. However, cosmological parameters change with time and the power index of the power spectrum dramatically varies with mass scale in the so-called concordance {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Thus, any successful model for its structural evolution should work well simultaneously for various cosmological models and different power spectra. We use a large set of high-resolution N-body simulations of a variety of structure formation models (scale-free, standard CDM, open CDM, and {$\Lambda$}CDM) to study the mass accretion histories, the mass and redshift dependence of concentrations, and the concentration evolution histories of dark matter halos. We find that there is significant disagreement between the much-used empirical models in the literature and our simulations. Based on our simulation results, we find that the mass accretion rate of a halo is tightly correlated with a simple function of its mass, the redshift, parameters of the cosmology, and of the initial density fluctuation spectrum, which correctly disentangles the effects of all these factors and halo environments. We also find that the concentration of a halo is strongly correlated with the universe age when its progenitor on the mass accretion history first reaches 4\% of its current mass. According to these correlations, we develop new empirical models for both the mass accretion histories and the concentration evolution histories of dark matter halos, and the latter can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of halo concentrations. These models are accurate and universal: the same set of model parameters works well for different cosmological models and for halos of different masses at different redshifts, and in the {$\Lambda$}CDM case the model predictions match the simulation results very well even though halo mass is traced to about 0.0005 times the final mass, when cosmological parameters and the power index of the initial density fluctuation spectrum have changed dramatically. Our model predictions also match the PINOCCHIO mass accretion histories very well, which are much independent of our numerical simulations and our definitions of halo merger trees. These models are also simple and easy to implement, making them very useful in modeling the growth and structure of dark matter halos. We provide appendices describing the step-by-step implementation of our models. A calculator which allows one to interactively generate data for any given cosmological model is provided on the Web, together with a user-friendly code to make the relevant calculations and some tables listing the expected concentration as a function of halo mass and redshift in several popular cosmological models. We explain why {$\Lambda$}CDM and open CDM halos on nearly all mass scales show two distinct phases in their mass growth histories. We discuss implications of the universal relations we find in connection to the formation of dark matter halos in the cosmic density field.},

  abstract = {Daddi et al. have recently reported strong clustering of a population of red galaxies at z\textasciitilde 3 in the Hubble Deep Field-South. Fitting the observed angular clustering with a power law of index -0.8, they infer a comoving correlation length r\_0\textasciitilde 8 Mpc/h; for a standard cosmology, this r\_0 would imply that the red galaxies reside in rare, M{$>$}10\^\{13\} Msun/h halos, with each halo hosting \textasciitilde 100 galaxies to match the number density of the population. Using the framework of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) in a \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM universe, we show that the Daddi et al. data can be adequately reproduced by less surprising models, e.g., models with galaxies residing in halos of mass M{$>$}M\_min=6.3x10\^\{11\} Msun/h and a mean occupation Navg(M)=1.4(M/M\_min)\^\{0.45\} above this cutoff. The resultant correlation functions do not follow a strict power law, showing instead a clear transition from the 1-halo dominated regime, where the two galaxies of each pair reside in the same dark matter halo, to the 2-halo dominated regime, where the two galaxies of each pair are from different halos. The observed high-amplitude data points lie in the one-halo-dominated regime, so these HOD models are able to explain the observations despite having smaller correlation lengths, r\_0\textasciitilde 5 Mpc/h. HOD parameters are only loosely constrained by the current data because of large sample variance and the lack of clustering information on scales that probe the 2-halo regime. If our explanation of the data is correct, then future observations covering a larger area should show that the large scale correlations lie below a \textbackslash theta\^\{-1.8\} extrapolation of the small scale points. Our models of the current data suggest that the red galaxies are somewhat more strongly clustered than UV-selected Lyman-break galaxies and have a greater tendency to reside in small groups.},

  abstract = {We model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function of DEEP2 (z\textasciitilde 1) and SDSS (z\textasciitilde 0) galaxies within the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework. At both epochs, there is a tight correlation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing for larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreasing at higher luminosity. Central L* galaxies reside in halos a few times more massive at z\textasciitilde 1 than at z\textasciitilde 0. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions of the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between the galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z\textasciitilde 0 central galaxies to z\textasciitilde 1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos, which enables us to study the evolution of galaxies as a function of halo mass. We find that the stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z\textasciitilde 0 low mass halos (\textasciitilde 5x10\^11 Msun/h) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high mass halos (\textasciitilde 10\^13 Msun/h) result from star formation between z\textasciitilde 1 and z\textasciitilde 0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time. Future work can combine HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different redshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter halos. This can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.

The modeling results show that most of these luminous red galaxies (LRGs) are central galaxies residing in massive halos of typical mass M \textasciitilde{} a few times 10\^13 to 10\^14 Msun/h, while a few percent of them have to be satellites within halos in order to produce the strong auto-correlations exhibited on smaller scales. The mean luminosity Lc of central LRGs increases with the host halo mass, with a rough scaling relation of Lc \textbackslash propto M\^0.5. The halo mass required to host on average one satellite LRG above a luminosity threshold is found to be about 10 times higher than that required to host a central LRG above the same threshold. We find that in massive halos the distribution of L* galaxies roughly follows that of the dark matter and their mean occupation number scales with halo mass as M\^1.5. The HOD modeling results also allows for an intuitive understanding of the scale-dependent luminosity dependence of the cross-correlation between LRGs and L\_* galaxies. Constraints on the LRG HOD provide tests to models of formation and evolution of massive galaxies, and they are also useful for cosmological parameter investigations. In one of the appendices, we provide LRG HOD parameters with dependence on cosmology inferred from modeling the two-point auto-correlation functions of LRGs.},
